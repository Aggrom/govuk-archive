<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Chemical manufacturing businesses produce waste that can have a harmful impact on the environment, such as process residues, spent catalysts or solvents, effluent treatment sludges and contaminated chemical containers.</p>

<p>The chemical industry includes producers of commodity chemicals such as organic and inorganic chemicals and industrial gases, and speciality chemicals such as pharmaceutical products and essential oils. It also includes mixing, blending, diluting or converting basic chemicals to make chemical products and preparations, eg paints, pesticides, inks, detergents and cosmetics.</p>

<p>Waste from your business can cause pollution if you do not manage it correctly. You must comply with your duty of care when you dispose of all wastes.</p>

<p>Reducing the waste your business produces can help you to comply with your legal obligations, reduce purchasing and waste disposal costs, and reduce the risk of pollution incidents.</p>

<p>This guide explains your responsibilities for dealing with waste, including hazardous waste. It also includes guidance on how you can reduce waste and manage the waste production process.</p>

<h2 id="waste-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Waste responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that controlled waste you produce, store, treat, transport or dispose of does not harm the environment. This is called your duty of care.</p>

<p>Controlled waste is commercial, industrial and household waste, and may include hazardous waste, agricultural, construction and demolition waste.</p>

<p>Many substances discarded from chemical manufacturing are classed as waste, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>chemical process residues or spent raw materials, eg catalysts and sludges</li>
  <li>residues or unusable solutions of solvents or other chemicals</li>
  <li>sub-quality chemical products, eg adhesives, cleaning preparations, detergents, inks and paints</li>
  <li>contaminated chemical containers</li>
  <li>spent or spilled oil, lubricants and fuel</li>
  <li>contaminated absorbent materials used on spills</li>
  <li>used packaging, eg metal and plastic straps, and polypropylene</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="checking-if-you-need-a-permit-licence-or-exemption">Checking if you need a permit, licence or exemption</h3>

<p>You must have an environmental permit or registered waste exemption from the Environment Agency to use, store, collect, treat, recover, dismantle, recycle, burn or otherwise dispose of waste.</p>

<p>In some cases you may not need to register an exemption but you will still need to comply with the terms of an exemption. For example, you can usually store your own waste where it was produced temporarily, while you wait for it to be removed from your site.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-chemical-manufacturing">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for chemical manufacturing.</a></p>

<h3 id="applying-the-waste-management-hierarchy">Applying the waste management hierarchy</h3>

<p>You must apply the waste management hierarchy when you transfer waste. This means you must consider reusing or recycling your waste before deciding to dispose of it. </p>

<p>If you have an environmental permit for an operation which generates waste, you will have to apply the waste management hierarchy. This will be a condition of new environmental permits, and will be added to existing permits when they are reviewed.</p>

<h3 id="using-authorised-businesses-to-deal-with-your-waste">Using authorised businesses to deal with your waste</h3>

<p>The duty of care applies to controlled waste.</p>

<p>If your waste is collected by a waste carrier, broker or dealer you must check that they are registered or exempt from registration. Ask to see their certificate of registration or a certified copy. If you do not check and keep proof of this you could be held responsible if your waste is disposed of illegally, for example by fly-tipping. See the guide on how to manage your waste.](https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview).</p>

<p>If you take your own waste to another site you must check that the site has the appropriate environmental permit or registered exemption for your type of waste.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www2.environment-agency.gov.uk/epr/index.asp?lang=_e">Check if your waste carrier is registered on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.wastedirectory.org.uk/">Find licensed waste sites on the NetRegs Waste Directory website.</a></p>

<h3 id="checking-if-you-need-to-register-as-a-waste-carrier">Checking if you need to register as a waste carrier</h3>

<p>You can transport most waste produced by your own business directly to an authorised waste management site or recycling facility without being registered.</p>

<p>You must register with the Environment Agency as a waste carrier if you transport:</p>

<ul>
<li>construction and demolition waste produced by your own business</li>
  <li>any waste produced by another business</li>
</ul>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waste-carrier-licence">register and apply for a waste carrier licence from this site</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="using-waste-transfer-notes">Using waste transfer notes</h3>

<p>You must have a waste transfer note (<abbr title="waste transfer note">WTN</abbr>) for every load of waste you pass on or accept. <abbr title="waste transfer notes">WTNs</abbr> must be completed and signed by both the person sending the waste and the person receiving the waste. You must keep copies of all your <abbr title="waste transfer notes">WTNs</abbr> for at least two years.</p>

<p>You must make sure that your waste is treated before it goes to a landfill site. This applies to most types of waste. You can either treat your waste yourself or make sure that a later holder of the waste will treat it before they send it to a landfill site. For more information on your duty of care, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview">see the guide on how to manage your waste</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pre-treating-waste-for-landfill">Pre-treating waste for landfill</h3>

<p>You must make sure that your waste is treated before it goes to a landfill site. This applies to most types of waste. You can either treat your waste yourself or make sure that a later holder of the waste will treat it before they send it to a landfill site. </p>

<h3 id="following-hazardous-waste-controls">Following hazardous waste controls</h3>

<p>You must check if you have hazardous waste that may be harmful to human health or the environment. Most businesses produce some hazardous waste, such as solvents, oily sludges or used chemicals products, eg adhesives, some paints and inks.</p>

<p>You must comply with additional legal requirements for hazardous waste. See the page in this guide on hazardous waste responsibilities for chemical manufacturers.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-pollution-from-spills-of-waste">Preventing pollution from spills of waste</h3>

<p>You must ensure that you don’t cause pollution when you store and transport your waste. Separate different waste materials and store them in covered, waterproof containers with clear labels.</p>

<p>Prepare a pollution incident response plan. Ensure accidental spills can be contained. Keep spill kits at your site and portable spill kits in vehicles used to transport waste materials. See the page on pollution incident prevention at chemical manufacturing sites in the guide on how to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/prevent-pollution-from-chemical-manufacturing">prevent pollution from chemical manufacturing.</a></p>

<p>You may need to recycle or dispose of absorbent materials used to contain spills as hazardous waste. Check before you recycle or dispose of them.</p>

<h2 id="hazardous-waste-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Hazardous waste responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Your business is likely to produce some hazardous waste, which is harmful to human health or the environment. This waste may be flammable, corrosive, or ecotoxic - toxic to people or the environment.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-hazardous-waste">Examples of hazardous waste</h3>

<p>Hazardous wastes that you may produce from chemical manufacturing include:</p>

<ul>
<li>organic and inorganic chemical process residues, eg heavy ends and oily sludges</li>
  <li>used chemical products, eg adhesives, paints, inks and varnishes</li>
  <li>spoilt or unusable solvents or other chemicals</li>
  <li>spent or contaminated catalysts</li>
  <li>sludges, eg oily or from effluent treatment plants</li>
  <li>containers containing chemical residues, eg resins</li>
  <li>pollution containment equipment that has been used on spills of hazardous materials</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/GEHO0603BIRB-e-e.pdf">Download guidance on assessing whether waste is hazardous from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 545KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="identifying-hazardous-waste">Identifying hazardous waste</h3>

<p>If the waste you produce has hazardous properties, you may need to deal with it as hazardous waste. You will find information that can help you make this decision on safety data sheets and product labels. Safety data sheets contain information about substances, including how to store, use and dispose of them safely.</p>

<p>If you intend to discard containers, you must assess whether they are hazardous waste. Containers may need to be classified as hazardous waste if they contain residues of hazardous or dangerous substances or materials. If the residue is hazardous, the whole container will be hazardous waste.</p>

<h3 id="using-and-keeping-copies-of-paperwork">Using and keeping copies of paperwork</h3>

<p>If your business produces hazardous waste, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>use consignment notes whenever the waste is moved to another location, and keep copies for three years</li>
  <li>keep copies of return to producer forms for three years (these are records of what has happened to your waste)</li>
  <li>check whether you need to register annually with the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>comply with your duty of care for waste</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="storing-hazardous-waste-safely">Storing hazardous waste safely</h3>

<p>You must check if the waste you store is hazardous waste before you store it. </p>

<p>You must store hazardous waste securely and separately from all other waste materials. You must use containers that are sealed, labelled, covered and waterproof.</p>

<p>If you store hazardous waste you may need to comply with the conditions of a waste exemption or you may need an environmental permit.</p>

<h3 id="transporting-hazardous-waste-safely">Transporting hazardous waste safely</h3>

<p>You can currently carry your own hazardous waste without registering as a waste carrier. You must still complete a consignment note. However, from the end of December 2013 you will have to register with the Environment Agency as a lower tier waste carrier if you normally and regularly carry your own business waste.</p>

<p>If you carry hazardous waste produced by other businesses, or your own construction or demolition waste, you must usually register as an upper tier waste carrier. If you had a waste carrier certificate before 29 March 2011, it will be classified as an upper tier registration. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-waste-carrier-licence">register and apply for a waste carrier licence from this site.</a></p>
</div>

<p>If you pass your waste to someone else to transport for you, you must ensure that they are registered or exempt. <a rel="external" href="http://www2.environment-agency.gov.uk/epr/index.asp?lang=_e">Check if your waste carrier is registered on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-hazardous-waste-correctly">Disposing of hazardous waste correctly</h3>

<p>You must ensure that your hazardous waste is disposed of and treated at an appropriate facility. You should recover and recycle your hazardous waste wherever possible.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>Look for alternative materials and practices that do not produce, or produce less, hazardous waste.</p>

<p>Provide written instructions for storing and disposing of each type of hazardous waste produced on your premises. Ensure that all employees and contractors follow these instructions.</p>

<p>See the page in this guide on how to separate and manage hazardous waste from chemical manufacturing.</p>

<h2 id="waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-obligations-for-chemical-manufacturers">Waste electrical and electronic equipment obligations for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Waste electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>) is the fastest growing type of waste in the UK. You must handle and store it correctly and ensure that it is treated, recycled or disposed of at an authorised facility. Where possible you should reuse <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Common types of <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>computers and other office equipment</li>
  <li>fluorescent light tubes</li>
  <li>fridges</li>
  <li>washing machines</li>
  <li>televisions</li>
  <li>vending machines</li>
  <li>mobile phones</li>
</ul>
<p>Other electrical and electronic equipment at your chemicals manufacturing site may include monitors and other diagnostic equipment to track or develop chemical reaction processes.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-weee-correctly">Dealing with <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> correctly</h3>

<p>Your business must store, collect, treat, recycle and dispose of <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> separately from other waste.</p>

<p>You must get and keep proof that you gave your <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> to an authorised waste management company, and that they treated and disposed of it without harming the environment.</p>

<p>You may be able to use a free take-back scheme for <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> funded by the equipment manufacturer.</p>

<p>If any of your <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> contains batteries you may also have to deal with waste batteries. See guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/battery-waste-producer-and-supplier-responsibilities">battery waste: producer and supplier responsibilities.</a></p>

<p>If your <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> contains hazardous substances, you will need to treat it as hazardous waste. This includes fluorescent light tubes and televisions that contain cathode ray tubes. </p>

<p>If you have any old equipment, such as capacitors or transformers, at your site it may be contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (<abbr title="polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>). You must arrange for the safe disposal or decontamination of all equipment that contains <abbr title="polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> as soon as possible. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">hazardous substance responsibilities for chemical manufacturers.</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-reduce-waste-from-chemical-manufacturing">How to reduce waste from chemical manufacturing</h2>

<p>The cheapest and most environmentally friendly way to deal with your waste is to reduce the amount that you produce.</p>

<p>By reducing, reusing and recycling your waste you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>save money on waste disposal</li>
  <li>reduce costs for managing and handling your waste</li>
  <li>improve your environmental performance</li>
  <li>improve your reputation with staff, customers and the public</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="your-waste-responsibilities">Your waste responsibilities</h3>

<p>If your business produces or handles waste, certain waste responsibilities will apply to you, even if you recycle materials such as solvents. See the page in this guide on waste responsibilities for chemical manufacturers.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-waste-in-key-areas">Reducing waste in key areas</h3>

<p>Although you may not be able to completely eliminate waste from your chemicals business, you should be able to take a number of practical steps to minimise the amount you produce. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>improving the way your business purchases and stores materials - see the page in this guide on how to manage raw materials to reduce waste in chemical manufacturing</li>
  <li>separating hazardous waste so that it does not contaminate other non-hazardous waste - see the page in this guide on how to separate and manage hazardous waste from chemical manufacturing</li>
  <li>using vacuum systems effectively within your business - see the page in this guide on vacuum systems and hazardous waste in chemicals manfacturing</li>
  <li>reviewing how vessels are designed and washed in your business - see the page in this guide on reaction vessel hazardous waste in chemicals manufacturing</li>
  <li>treating effluent before it is disposed of - see the page in this guide on treating hazardous effluent from chemical manufacturing</li>
  <li>reducing chemical effluent production by using less water - see the guide on water use and efficiency in chemical manufacturing</li>
  <li>reducing your use of solvents - see the page on solvent use responsibilities for chemical manufacturers in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">hazardous substance responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adopting-a-systematic-approach">Adopting a systematic approach</h3>

<p>You should adopt a systematic approach to reducing waste at your site. If you have an environmental management system (<abbr title="environmental management system">EMS</abbr>), or intend to set one up, you should use this to manage your waste. If you don’t have the time or resources to set up an <abbr title="environmental management system">EMS</abbr>, you could review the waste produced by your business, produce an action plan and set targets to reduce it. WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme) provides information on waste management issues including recycling, construction waste, retail waste and composting. <a rel="external" href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/">Read about reducing waste and recycling on the WRAP website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="managing-raw-materials-to-reduce-waste-in-chemical-manufacturing">Managing raw materials to reduce waste in chemical manufacturing</h2>

<p>Your chemical business can reduce the overall amount of waste you handle by improving how you select and store raw materials and substances. By carefully selecting your raw materials, you can reduce your environmental impact and your costs.</p>

<h3 id="managing-raw-materials">Managing raw materials</h3>

<p>Monitor your use of raw materials so you can rationalise the number of suppliers you have and the raw materials you use and keep in in stock. This should:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce the number of incompatible wastes</li>
  <li>simplify storage and collection arrangements for hazardous wastes</li>
  <li>lower the risk of raw materials becoming out of specification or out of date</li>
  <li>cut the amount of packaging classed as hazardous waste</li>
</ul>
<p>Work with your supply chain to improve efficiency and save money. For example, ask your supplier to deliver raw materials in containers that you can return to them or send to a specialist recycler. </p>

<p>Set up centralised raw material and waste control areas and make certain members of staff responsible for stock and waste management. You should sort and separate hazardous wastes in a defined area for collection by a specialist contractor. See the page in this guide on how to separate and manage hazardous waste from chemical manufacturing.</p>

<p>Substitute hazardous raw materials with less hazardous alternatives and look at changing your manufacturing processes to reduce the amount of hazardous waste you produce. See the page on using green chemistry in chemical manufacturing in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/efficient-design-and-resource-use-in-chemical-manufacturing">efficient design and resource use in chemical manufacturing.</a></p>

<p>Purchase raw materials in bulk to use fewer containers and reduce residual waste.</p>

<h2 id="separating-and-managing-hazardous-waste-from-chemical-manufacturing">Separating and managing hazardous waste from chemical manufacturing</h2>

<p>Seperate hazardous waste from all other wastes to manage it effectively.</p>

<p>Using coloured bins can be a fast and cost-effective system. For example, you could use:</p>

<ul>
<li>red bins for general hazardous waste</li>
  <li>black bins for oily rags and absorbents used to clean-up spills</li>
  <li>brown bins for contaminated packaging</li>
  <li>green bins for non-hazardous waste - or as appropriate for different reusable and recyclable materials</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to correctly separate all the hazardous waste your business produces. Even a small amount of hazardous waste in a non-hazardous waste bin is likely to result in the whole container having to be classified as hazardous waste. This will increase the cost of disposal.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-contaminated-packaging-and-personal-protective-equipment-correctly">Disposing of contaminated packaging and personal protective equipment correctly</h3>

<p>You should remember that any packaging contaminated with even low levels of hazardous raw material may be considered hazardous waste. You will need to assess the level of contaminants in your waste and dispose of it safely. See the page in this guide on hazardous waste responsibilities for chemical manufacturers.</p>

<p>You can take steps to clean contaminated packaging, eg with vacuum systems. You can then recycle or dispose of the packaging as non-hazardous waste in the usual way. You can usually dispose of the cleaning agent in your normal trade effluent. However, you must make sure that you comply with the conditions of your trade effluent consent if you have one. The Environment Agency can give you guidance on consent for discharging trade effluent. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/contactus/36324.aspx">Find your local Environment Agency office on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also clean contaminated personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) such as gloves or overalls for reuse or recycling.</p>

<h3 id="managing-filter-cake">Managing filter cake</h3>

<p>You should manage batch and continuous filter-cake production carefully by:</p>

<ul>
<li>increasing the proportion of dry, solid content through dewatering and chemical conditioning</li>
  <li>separating filter cakes</li>
  <li>recycling recovered solids</li>
  <li>reusing filtrate liquors</li>
  <li>separating spent recant solution and process liquors to avoid mixing incompatible waste streams - this will make it easier to regenerate or recycle components</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vacuum-systems-and-hazardous-waste-in-chemical-manufacturing">Vacuum systems and hazardous waste in chemical manufacturing</h2>

<p>Vacuum systems are widely used throughout the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, for example in reaction vessels and distillation columns. They improve the overall efficiency of reactions at lower temperatures and can make it easier to handle materials.</p>

<p>Using a vacuum system for complex chemical reactions often produces hazardous waste. Dealing with hazardous waste correctly can be expensive due to the treatment required and the lack of available disposal facilities. Any increase in your vacuum systems’ efficiency can reduce hazardous waste levels and your disposal costs.</p>

<p>You will need to assess the level of contaminants in your waste and dispose of it safely. See the page in this guide on hazardous waste responsibilities for chemical manufacturers.</p>

<h3 id="improving-your-process">Improving your process</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways in which your business could improve its use of vacuum systems including:</p>

<ul>
<li>improving filtration rates, which improves the properties of the filter cake and helps to reduce the materials lost within it</li>
  <li>making more efficient use of your vacuum system as this can significantly reduce running costs</li>
  <li>using a dead-end filling technique that reduces the problem of excessive discharges and pollutants that you must dispose of</li>
  <li>undertaking planned and preventative maintenance on your systems before they fail</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquid-ring-pumps">Liquid ring pumps</h3>

<p>You can reduce hazardous waste by eliminating the unnecessary use of water in liquid ring pumps. You could fit solenoid valves on the seal- and cooling-water supplies and interlock these valves to the main power supply to the pump drive. Water will then flow only when the pump is running.</p>

<p>Another solution is to convert the pump from a once-through water seal to a recirculating water seal. This option depends on the degree of contamination picked up on each pass of the liquid. You could also replace the seal water with an alternative liquid to produce waste that is easier to handle and dispose of.</p>

<h2 id="reaction-vessel-hazardous-waste-in-chemicals-manufacturing">Reaction vessel hazardous waste in chemicals manufacturing</h2>

<p>Many of the chemical manufacturing processes your business uses take place in dedicated reaction vessels that will need washing. The washing process can generate significant levels of hazardous waste. Also, the flexibility that stirred-tank reactions offer your business can mean that raw materials are often not used efficiently.</p>

<p>Larger chemical manufacturing processes often use vessels for mixing, reaction and product separation. These vessels can have a blind spot on their mixing blades and drainage design that can be improved. When your business replaces a vessel, you should choose a design that:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoids wastage when it is emptied</li>
  <li>reduces the need for cleaning</li>
  <li>enables (where possible) cleaning in place to occur with automated changing and emptying</li>
</ul>
<p>If your business is able to use low-inventory fast reactors, these can offer your business a number of savings, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduced need for cleaning</li>
  <li>less product waste at the end of the reaction run</li>
  <li>less void space/dead legs where product could hide</li>
  <li>cost savings, as the vessel is usually designed for one specific process</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vessel-design-and-washing-advice">Vessel design and washing advice</h3>

<p>There are a number of steps your business can take to improve its overall vessel design and washing including:</p>

<ul>
<li>reducing the amount of washing that takes place and the amount of wash liquor that is used, as this reduces effluent</li>
  <li>improving staff awareness of the environmental and financial implications of excessive washing and effluent production</li>
  <li>logging vessel activity to minimise the need for washing between product batches</li>
  <li>changing your production processes to reduce the need for vessel washing</li>
  <li>recovering used wash liquor and switching to alternative, less hazardous washing agents</li>
  <li>full vessel drain-down</li>
  <li>using high-pressure washing systems, as they are more efficient and reduce the volume of wash liquor needed</li>
  <li>automating the washing process, as computer-controlled systems can be more accurate and improve washing performance</li>
  <li>installing closed-loop systems that minimise emissions, improve solvent use and protect operators from contact with wash liquors - closed-loop systems enable wash liquors to be reused rather than disposed of after each wash</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="treating-hazardous-effluent-from-chemical-manufacturing">Treating hazardous effluent from chemical manufacturing</h2>

<p>One of the main issues for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries is the production of hazardous effluent (liquid waste). Techniques your business could employ to treat the effluent it produces include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Diversion - it is important that your business has diversion systems in place. These redirect any hazardous effluent from your processes into a temporary storage facility. You can then deal with the discharge appropriately at a later date.</li>
  <li>Equalisation and balancing - if you can control fluctuations in the characteristics of the effluent, your waste can be dealt with more easily by subsequent treatment processes.</li>
  <li>Neutralisation - some of the effluent your business produces may be acidic or alkaline. It is important to neutralise the pH of these streams as soon as possible to help with disposal. If your site has both acidic and alkaline effluent, consider combining these at your diversion facility. This minimises your effluent disposal costs.</li>
  <li>Dissolved air flotation - this method of effluent treatment is usually used to remove any suspended solids and part of the effluent’s organic load prior to any further treatment downstream.</li>
  <li>Wet air oxidation - the pre-treatment of some high chemical-oxygen-demand effluents can be achieved by oxidation of the organic pollutants at high temperature and pressure using air, hydrogen peroxide or oxygen. You can use wet air oxidation to convert organic compounds to CO2, water and nitrogen or break down more complex structures within the effluent before further treatment.</li>
  <li>Activated sludge - this effluent process is an aerobic biological treatment in which bacteria and other microorganisms feed on biodegradable organic material in the effluent and degrade it. However, the microorganisms do require nutrients such as nitrogen to support their growth.</li>
  <li>Sludge thickening and dewatering - these are mechanical processes that are designed to reduce the volume of sludge. Methods currently in use include gravity thickeners, decanters and drum thickeners. This technique is usually carried out using a centrifuge, belt press or plate-and-frame press.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the page on effluent treatment and reuse in chemical manufacturing in the guide on water use and efficiency in chemical manufacturing.</p>

<h3 id="checking-if-you-need-authorisation-to-discharge-wastewater">Checking if you need authorisation to discharge wastewater</h3>

<p>Your effluent may contain increased levels of contaminants such as heavy metals, hydrocarbons, resins or solvents.</p>

<p>Before you discharge wastewater to surface waters or groundwater, you must have authorisation from the Environment Agency. You will need to treat effluent extensively before you can discharge it to surface waters or groundwater.</p>

<p>Before you discharge wastewater to a sewer, you must get permission from your water and sewerage company. You may need to pre-treat your effluent before you discharge it to the sewer.</p>

<h2 id="how-henkel-benefited-from-reducing-hazardous-waste">How Henkel benefited from reducing hazardous waste</h2>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.henkel.co.uk">Henkel</a></p>

<h3 id="henkels-top-tips">Henkel’s top tips:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Undertake a review of hazardous waste arisings and identify options for reduction.</li>
  <li>Collect ‘washout’ and re-blend it to provide additional raw material for future production.</li>
  <li>Provide staff with environmental and technical training to optimise production and minimise waste.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Henkel Consumer Adhesives is part of the Henkel Group KGaA and employs 450 staff at its site in Winsford, Cheshire. The consumer adhesives business has a turnover of approximately £100 million per year and is a direct supplier to many large retailers. Henkel manufactures a wide variety of branded products such as Pritt Stick, Loctite, No More Nails, Sellotape and Nitromors Paint Stripper.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-did">What we did</h3>

<p>As part of Henkel’s drive for continual improvements within the framework of their ISO 14001 environmental management system, and in response to rising hazardous waste treatment and disposal costs, Henkel carried out a review to reduce the volume of hazardous waste.</p>

<p>One of the site’s key hazardous waste streams was from the Nitromors production facility, where addition of methylene chloride (dichloromethane) in the raw material created a waste product that was classified as hazardous because it was toxic. The three production lines produce five Nitromors blends, with each line requiring a washout prior to a change in blend.</p>

<p>Historically, production line residues were ‘washed’ into 210-litre steel drums and stored on site until sufficient amounts had been collected - typically three months. The waste was disposed of under contract as hazardous waste, treated to reduce its hazardous and toxic properties, and incinerated at high temperatures. Treatment and disposal of approximately 20,000 litres was costing Henkel £9,000 per year.</p>

<p>Led by the safety, health, environment and quality team, a new system for collecting washout was implemented. Five individual polycarbonate chemical storage drums are now used to collect specific blends of Nitromors from line washouts and the product is re-blended back into blenders, providing additional raw material for future production.</p>

<p>The business ensured that staff received environmental and technical training to optimise production and minimise waste.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-benefits-were">What the benefits were</h3>

<p>Henkel has saved around £9,000 per year by changing the way that washout is collected and dealt with. The measure cost around £100 to implement and led to approximately 20,000 litres per year of hazardous waste being diverted from treatment and disposal.</p>

<p>Other benefits included:</p>

<ul>
<li>additional feedstock from recycled waste product</li>
  <li>reduced environmental risk as large quantities of drummed hazardous waste no longer needed to be stored outside</li>
  <li>reduced road transport required to collect waste</li>
  <li>energy saved from eliminating hazardous waste treatment</li>
</ul>
