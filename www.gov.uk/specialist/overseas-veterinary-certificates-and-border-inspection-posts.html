<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If your business imports live animals and/or products of animal origin (<abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>) into the UK, your consignments will be subject to the Community Veterinary Checks Regime. This regime requires that all third country live animal and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> through a designated <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>. In the UK, most <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> are operated by port health authorities and local authorities. <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> that only accept products not for human consumption and live animals are operated by Animal Health.</p>

<p>All your <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments must be pre-notified to the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> and presented with the correct documentation, including the health certificate(s) that relate to the specific consignment you are importing. Inspectors at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> will check your consignment to ensure that it meets <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> import conditions. There is a fee payable for this work.</p>

<p>This guide gives you detailed information on how to get veterinary certificates so that you can import <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> products into the UK from a third country.</p>

<h2 id="veterinary-certificates-required">Veterinary certificates required</h2>

<p>For live animals and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> to enter the UK, consignments must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation such as veterinary certificates issued by the official veterinarian in the country of origin or import licences. Commercial documents like invoices, packing lists and the Bill of Lading will also be requested.</p>

<p><abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> are goods containing material sourced from an animal, such as meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish, eggs, honey, fur, skin and semen. Other products such as hay and straw that might have come into contact with animals are also covered. For further information you can see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/animal-products-import-and-export">products of animal origin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="common-veterinary-entry-document-cved">Common Veterinary Entry Document (<abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>)</h3>

<p>In order for your consignment to clear Customs/enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you need to have a validated <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>. The certificate proves that the checks laid down in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK law have been carried out and that the consignment may be released for free circulation. In the case of products not fit for human consumption it may also specify the address to which the goods must be delivered.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> is used:</p>

<ul>
<li>to notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of the arrival of your consignment in advance of its arrival (Part 1 is completed by the declarant, or person responsible for the consignment)</li>
  <li>to notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of the arrival of live animals at least 24 hours ahead of their arrival</li>
  <li>to record the results of the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> checks (Part 2 is completed by the official at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>by the customs authority as proof that the consignment has been checked and to show the intended use of the consignment</li>
</ul>
<p>You must keep the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> for at least one year from the date of import, as a local authority can request it as proof of the goods’ legal import. You can download a blank <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> and explanatory notes from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/blankcved.pdf">Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website (PDF, 200KB).</a></p>

<p>You can submit the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> manually or once registered to use it, electronically via the Trade Control and Expert System (<abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>). See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/using-traces-to-trade-in-animals-and-animal-products">using <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> to trade in animals and animal products</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> is a web-based service through which you must apply for <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificates">ITAHCs</abbr> for exporting and CVEDs for importing live animals, their products and germplasm. For more information on <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificates">ITAHCs</abbr>, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087336865&amp;r.l3=1087336885&amp;r.l4=1079819397&amp;topicId=1078105203">agriculture, horticulture and fisheries</a>.</p>

<p>You must have the correct type of documentation for your <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments to avoid fines, the costs of having your goods stored, re-transported or destroyed and/or the risk of legal proceedings.</p>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will not release <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments until they are satisfied that a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> has been issued and inspection fees have been paid.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-a-veterinary-certificate">Do I need a veterinary certificate?</h3>

<p>Not all products derived from animals require a health certificate from their country of origin or a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> before they can move through customs and into free circulation. Imported wool, for instance, doesn’t require a health certificate but does require a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>. Highly processed foods such as chocolate products usually don’t require a health certificate or a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> when entering the UK. A list of products that are subject to veterinary checks are laid down in Annex I to Commission Decision 2007/275/EC. You can download Commission Decision 2007/275/EC from the <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2007/l_116/l_11620070504en00090033.pdf">Europa website (PDF, 118K).</a></p>

<p>Products containing both processed product of animal origin and products of plant origin are not always covered by the regulations. Read about composite products for human consumption from countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/animaltrade/imports/iins/composite">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website</a> to help you work out whether the rules apply to your consignment. If you are in any doubt you should seek advice from Animal Health or the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of import before you order the consignment.</p>

<p>Check with the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr>/<abbr title="Official Fish Inspector">OFI</abbr> at the port of entry you plan to use for clarification about your consignment classification to see if it requires a health certificate. If it does, these can be obtained from your supplier. Also, you must give the port notice of your consignment’s arrival. To find out how to obtain the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> see the page in this guide on veterinary certificates. In some cases your consignments will also require an import licence to enter the UK.</p>

<p>Read about general import licences for animals and products of animal origin on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/animaltrade/imports/licences/index.htm">Defra website.</a></p>

<h3 id="emergency-and-short-term-bans">Emergency and short-term bans</h3>

<p>When disease breaks out in a particular geographic area or country that creates a serious threat to animal or public health, Defra has the right and obligation to ban imports of affected live animals and/or their products, as appropriate, from the affected country or region. These declarations supersede the validity of CVEDs or import licences. You can find the list of current and historic Declarations on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/animaltrade/imports/declarations/index.htm">Defra website</a>  </p>

<h2 id="border-inspection-posts">Border Inspection Posts</h2>

<p><abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> are operated by local authorities who are responsible for the health controls of goods coming into the UK via seaports and airports. <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> are based at several locations throughout the UK and employ the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeons">OVSs</abbr> and <abbr title="Official Fish Inspectors">OFIs</abbr> who carry out all consignment checks. Their role is to check that imports of all live animals and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> conform to regulations and are accompanied by the appropriate documentation.</p>

<p>You can find the list of UK <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> for <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/animaltrade/imports/bips/">Defra website</a> and access contact details of the <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> in all European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/bips/bips_contact_en.htm">Europa website</a></p>

<h3 id="specified-risk-material">Specified Risk Material</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments that your business imports into the UK require a veterinary certificate to ensure they aren’t infected with any transmittable diseases. While there are many infections that could be carried by your consignments, one of the most serious is transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The authority that issues your health certificate should ensure that the consignments are free from all major diseases.</p>

<p>You can browse the index to importer information notices on general conditions and veterinary checks for importing live animals and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export/">Defra website.</a></p>

<p>The regulations don’t apply to:</p>

<ul>
<li>cosmetic or medicinal products or medical devices, or to their starting materials or intermediate products</li>
  <li>products which aren’t intended for use in human food, animal feed or fertilisers, or their starting materials or intermediate products</li>
  <li>products of animal origin intended for exhibition, teaching, scientific research, special studies or analysis, provided those products aren’t eventually consumed or used by humans or by animals other than those kept for the research projects concerned</li>
  <li>live animals used in or intended for research</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the correct documentation to satisfy the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr>/<abbr title="Official Fish Inspector">OFI</abbr> at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> and that the products in your consignments as listed above will not be consumed and that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent this from happening by accident.</p>

<h2 id="handling-products-of-animal-origin-on-arrival-from-eu-member-states-or-third-countries">Handling products of animal origin on arrival from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states or third countries</h2>

<p>Any of your consignments that contain live animals or <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> originating from another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state can usually enter the UK without any further checks. This is due to the harmonisation of the animal health systems in all member states.</p>

<p>Each member state has agreed levels of animal health that apply to all intra-community imports and exports. Health checks at borders can be dispensed with if the consignment meets the required level of animal hygiene before it leaves its original country. Exceptions can arise when there are outbreaks of disease such as Foot and Mouth.</p>

<p>Imports of <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> from third countries, however, are strictly controlled by the issue of veterinary certificates and only then from countries that meet certain criteria - eg the health status of their livestock, other domestic animals and wildlife and membership of the <abbr title="World Organisation of Animal Health">WOAH</abbr>. Each of your consignments must be accompanied by a health certificate. This should always be issued by the health authority in the country of origin. Generally, paper copies of the original health certificate should accompany each of your consignments.</p>

<p>Before your consignments arrive at a <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>, you must notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of their arrival by submitting a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> with Part 1 completed. </p>

<p>So that the consignment can be checked, you’ll need to submit the health certificate and any relevant commercial documentation such as a copy of the invoice and Bill of Lading. Your consignments will then undergo a documentary check that confirms whether:</p>

<ul>
<li>pre-notification has taken place</li>
  <li>all documents have been completed properly</li>
  <li>the certification of the consignment is correct </li>
  <li>the products contained within the consignment originate from an approved establishment</li>
  <li>the country is authorised to export and is on the list of countries with an approved residue plan</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the list of approved third country establishments on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/establishments/third_country/index_en.htm">Europa website.</a></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr> or <abbr title="Official Fish Inspector">OFI</abbr> may then carry out checks.</p>

<ul>
<li>The consignment itself will be checked unless it has an official veterinary seal to ensure that it matches the details in the certificate (an identity check).</li>
  <li>In some cases the inspector will also carry out a more detailed examination of the product (a physical check), this may include laboratory analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>On completion of the veterinary checks, part 2 of the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> will be completed and signed by the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr>/<abbr title="Official Fish Inspector">OFI</abbr>. Note that a signed <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> will be required for each consignment, even if the main consignment is split into smaller loads. If the consignment is split down at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>, multiple CVEDs will be issued to ensure that each part of the load is covered.</p>

<h3 id="additional-checks">Additional checks</h3>

<p>In some cases you’ll need additional analysis, for example if there has been a contaminant or serious problem in a previous consignment from the same source. You’ll have to pay for any checks requested by the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr>. If a commercial store is used while the additional checks are carried out, you’ll have to meet the full cost. It may become necessary to have checks carried out to confirm an <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr> finding.</p>

<h3 id="keep-up-to-date">Keep up to date</h3>

<p>As the UK import procedure includes a health certificate issued by the exporting third country, it’s important that you keep up to date with the latest developments in that country. You can read the Customer Information Notes for the latest news on animal exports and imports on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/animaltrade/cins/index.htm">Defra website.</a></p>

<p>You can also download a blank <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> and the explanatory notes accompanying it on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/blankcved.pdf"><abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> website (PDF, 201KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="declarations-at-the-border-inspection-post">Declarations at the Border Inspection Post</h2>

<p>You must make sure that the <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> your business imports enters the UK via a <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> operated by the Port Health Authority. You can view a list of <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> for <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/animaltrade/imports/bips/">Defra website</a>. You can find contact information for local authority run <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.porthealth.co.uk/port_directory.php">Association of Port Health Authorities website.</a> In Scotland <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> are supervised by the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate and in Northern Ireland by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>

<h3 id="traces"><abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr></h3>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive 97/78/EC requires that the person responsible for any consignment that contains <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> present the consignment to the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> with part 1 of the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> completed. This is usually done electronically via the <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/using-traces-to-trade-in-animals-and-animal-products">using <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> to trade in animals and animal products</a>.</p>

<h3 id="customs-responsibilities">Customs responsibilities</h3>

<p>Consignments undergo veterinary and paperwork checks at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of entry to ensure that they meet import conditions.</p>

<p>After your consignment has successfully completed veterinary checks and the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr> has endorsed your <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>, your consignment can move through customs. You will need to check local arrangements for transmitting the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> document to the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Hub to ensure that <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> are aware that the veterinary checks have been satisfactorily completed. At some <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> you or your clearing agent will need to arrange to collect the completed <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> from the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> and fax it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="supporting-documents">Supporting documents</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments that you bring into the UK will also be required to have other supporting documents. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/international-trade-paperwork-the-basics">international trade paperwork: the basics</a>.</p>

<h3 id="additional-requirements">Additional requirements</h3>

<p>Any <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments you import into the UK which also have organic status must be supported with the appropriate certificates. Read the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/organic-produce-how-to-become-an-importer">importing organic produce</a>.</p>

<p>Organic imports from non-approved third countries must also have Defra authorisation. Some third countries have approved status which means that they have achieved a high enough level of organic quality to match those in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The current list of approved countries includes: Argentina, Australia, Costa Rica, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and Tunisia. You can download an introduction to organic certification for importers from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.organicfarmers.org.uk/download/publications/processing-guide-v2.pdf">Organic Farmers and Growers website (PDF, 156K).</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-make-changes-to-documents-accompanying-products-of-animal-origin">How to make changes to documents accompanying products of animal origin</h2>

<p>All documents that accompany your <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> must be originals. The original veterinary health certificates must be stamped, dated and signed by an authorised veterinary surgeon in the third country.</p>

<p>All documents must be in English, or include an English translation.</p>

<p>Only the official who produced a veterinary health certificate is authorised to make any changes to it. You should also be aware that: </p>

<ul>
<li>All documents must be legible. There is no international agreement that documents must be typed, but this is preferable.</li>
  <li>Correction fluid must not be used in any circumstances. This could trigger an investigation into why the document(s) were amended that could delay the processing of your consignment(s).</li>
  <li>Any alternations must be crossed through but not completely deleted. The changes should be stamped and signed by the person completing the documentation. Changes marked with an initial and not a stamp and signature are acceptable but at the official veterinary surgeon’s <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr>’s discretion.</li>
  <li>Faxes or photocopies of certificates aren’t acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replacement health certificates aren’t acceptable, as the certificate must have been issued while the consignment was in the exporting country. If there is a minor error on the certificate, do not have a replacement certificate issued. It may be possible to have an explanatory letter issued by the official who issued the certificate in the exporting country, at the discretion of the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="held-and-rejected-consignments-of-products-of-animal-origin">Held and rejected consignments of products of animal origin</h2>

<p>Your <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> consignments will be checked at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> by the resident <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr> or <abbr title="Official Fish Inspector">OFI</abbr>. If your goods fail the inspection, the consignment will have to be either destroyed, or transported outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="rejected-consignments">Rejected consignments</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> form that accompanies each of your consignments will show if the goods have been rejected. Consignments that are rejected must be either re-exported or destroyed. If you decide to re-export the consignment this must take place using the same transport method that you originally used to import the goods to the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>. Also, all other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> will be notified of the re-export via the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed to prevent the goods being illegally reintroduced into the Community via another port. The re-export must take place within 60 days or you will be charged for the destruction of the consignment.</p>

<p>The consignment can only be re-exported if it doesn’t present a serious animal or public health risk and with the agreement of the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr>/<abbr title="Official Fish Inspector">OFI</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="held-consignments">Held consignments</h3>

<p>Your consignment cannot be removed from the port until the checks have been completed and the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> issued. If you remove your consignment from the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> before the checks have been completed it will be dealt with as an illegal import and may be destroyed.</p>

<p>Customs clearance will not be given in respect of your consignment until the veterinary checks have been satisfactorily completed and all fees paid.</p>

<p>Consignments that have already made an intra-community journey can still be detained by the <abbr title="Official Veterinary Surgeon">OVS</abbr> if they believe your consignment poses a health risk, even though it’s been documented as acceptable in another member state. Your goods could be destroyed or permission given to use the goods for another acceptable purpose. In all cases you’ve the right to appeal against a decision via judicial review or a magistrate’s court.</p>
