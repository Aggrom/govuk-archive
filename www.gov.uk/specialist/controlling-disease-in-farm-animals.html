<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Disease outbreaks among farm animals can cause significant economic damage. However, you can limit the impact through preventative and control measures.</p>

<p>You must ensure that you follow biosecurity procedures, such as cleaning and disinfecting premises and vehicles. If there is an outbreak, government contingency plans will be followed. These plans include designating affected premises, setting up protection and surveillance zones, and controls on livestock movements.</p>

<p>This guide explains the special measures which apply in cases affecting poultry - such as avian influenza or ‘bird flu’ - and to the treatment of fresh meat, milk and milk products in affected areas.</p>

<p>This guide also outlines ways to reduce the risk of animal diseases being transmitted to humans, including procedures to protect visitors on open farms.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local Animal Health Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="biosecurity-and-disease-control">Biosecurity and disease control</h2>

<p>Biosecurity measures can help prevent the spread of farmed diseases - including notifiable diseases - across the UK. They also protect agricultural workers and visitors. Different biosecurity procedures apply to animals on farms and to animals being moved, for example to markets and agricultural shows.</p>

<p>Disease control through biosecurity focuses on controlling and reducing movements of animals, people and vehicles to and from areas where livestock is kept.</p>

<p>On-farm biosecurity measures include:</p>

<ul>
<li>cleaning and disinfecting protective clothing and vehicles before and after contact with animals</li>
  <li>use of disposable protective clothing</li>
</ul>
<p>During an outbreak, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) will usually impose restrictions on animal movements, and suspend agricultural markets and shows. Standard biosecurity measures at markets and shows are based on the ‘clean in, clean off’ principle, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>banning vehicles, equipment and clothing contaminated with animal excreta - except vehicle interiors and protective clothing taken off site for laundering</li>
  <li>cleaning contamination from clothes before leaving animal areas</li>
  <li>cleaning and disinfecting boots before leaving animal areas</li>
</ul>
<p>You should check the health status of livestock before buying or selling animals. New animals should be kept separate from existing stock on first arrival.</p>

<p>Read about routine good hygiene and biosecurity measures in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/disease-prevention-for-livestock-farmers">disease prevention</a>.</p>

<h3 id="biosecurity-for-specific-livestock-species">Biosecurity for specific livestock species</h3>

<p>There are also some biosecurity measures that you need to be aware of for specific animals.</p>

<h3 id="cattle">Cattle</h3>

<p>Cattle biosecurity measures follow general principles of controlling stock movement, and disinfecting vehicles and clothes belonging to people travelling between sites.</p>

<p>Related measures to control foot and mouth disease include covering disinfectant footbaths between uses so they are not diluted by rain. You should also prevent cattle from coming into contact with animals that cannot develop the disease, but can transmit infected material - for example, dogs, cats, poultry and foxes.</p>

<p>You can limit bovine tuberculosis transmission by deterring badgers from entering properties - for example with yard dogs, water jets or pigs - and ensuring that feed containers are sealed to prevent contamination.</p>

<p>Other control measures include the control of fallen stock - animals that die on your farm because of accident or disease. These control measures are of particular relevance to the control of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Carcasses are classed as animal by-products and must be disposed of under the rules of the National Fallen Stock Scheme or by an approved private contractor.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/fallen-stock">fallen stock</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pigs">Pigs</h3>

<p>Pig biosecurity procedures must be of a high standard to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as swine influenza. Pig farmers should:</p>

<ul>
<li>prohibit unnecessary visitors to the farm</li>
  <li>cleanse and disinfect any shared equipment before it enters and after it leaves your premises</li>
  <li>make sure that personnel in contact with pigs at different premises take standard precautions, such as cleaning and disinfecting boots and clothing</li>
  <li>prevent people with flu-like symptoms coming into contact with pigs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sheep-and-goats">Sheep and goats</h3>

<p>Sheep and goat biosecurity control follows the general principles of controlling movements of people and livestock, as well as disinfecting vehicles, equipment, clothing and footwear. Diseases of sheep and goats may not always be apparent in the early stages, so stock keepers should regularly monitor their animals for signs of illness.</p>

<p>As with cattle, fallen sheep and goats should be treated as animal by-products and disposed of using standard fallen stock procedures.</p>

<p>Read about disease prevention and control for sheep and goats in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/monitoring-prevention-and-control-of-disease-in-sheep-and-goats">sheep and goat health</a>.</p>

<h3 id="poultry">Poultry</h3>

<p>Poultry farmers can increase the biosecurity of flocks through standard control measures, such as washing hands after handling birds and disinfecting boots when travelling between farms.</p>

<p>Poultry-specific measures include:</p>

<ul>
<li>use of disposable protective clothing where practicable</li>
  <li>providing clean drinking water and food - preferably indoors to prevent contamination by wild animals</li>
  <li>isolating new birds</li>
  <li>having a plan for bringing a flock indoors if necessary</li>
  <li>cleaning and disinfecting housing at the end of each cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial poultry farmers should also follow salmonella control principles as part of the National Control Programme (<abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr>) for the disease. This involves providing <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> with the registration details of your business and the number of birds and flocks you have. You must also comply with sampling procedures, eg boot and sock swabs.</p>

<p>Read about biosecurity measures for poultry farmers in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/poultry-health">poultry health</a>.</p>

<h3 id="deer">Deer</h3>

<p>Biosecurity measures specific to deer - whether farmed, park or wild - include health monitoring for notifiable diseases such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>foot and mouth disease</li>
  <li>bovine tuberculosis</li>
  <li>bluetongue</li>
  <li>epizootic haemorrhagic virus disease</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to limit or prevent contact of deer with neighbouring livestock, and to be aware of the health status of any animals bought or sold.</p>

<p>Read about deer health and disease prevention in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/deer-health-welfare-and-movement">deer health, welfare and movement</a>.</p>

<h2 id="disinfectant-procedures-for-animal-diseases">Disinfectant procedures for animal diseases</h2>

<p>Disinfection is one of the main biosecurity measures to control the spread of animal diseases. Equipment, vehicles, protective clothing and footwear must all be cleaned and disinfected before and after contact with farm animals. Disinfectants can also be used as biosecurity barriers for vehicles and people at farm entrances.</p>

<p>Before disinfecting structures such as sheds, you should clean them with detergents to remove organic matter and oily films.</p>

<p>Disinfectants should be applied under low pressure, for example from a backpack sprayer.</p>

<h3 id="list-of-approved-disinfectants">List of approved disinfectants</h3>

<p>The Veterinary Laboratories Agency maintains a list of approved disinfectants for use in farming. The information provided includes supplier addresses and statutory dilution rates for use during control orders for:</p>

<ul>
<li>foot and mouth disease</li>
  <li>swine vesicular disease</li>
  <li>poultry diseases, including avian influenza</li>
  <li>tuberculosis</li>
  <li>other diseases</li>

<h3 id="disinfecting-livestock-vehicles">Disinfecting livestock vehicles</h3>

<p>There are special procedures which apply when disinfecting vehicles used to transport farm animals. For example, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>clean and disinfect vehicles as soon as possible after use involving animals</li>
  <li>clean wheel arches and mud flaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Drivers of empty, dirty vehicles leaving markets or slaughterhouses must complete a form to declare where their vehicles will be taken for cleaning.</p>

<h3 id="disinfectants-and-worker-safety">Disinfectants and worker safety</h3>

<p>You must ensure that farm workers use disinfectants safely, according to the agricultural Control of Substances Hazardous to Health regulations.</p>

<p>As well as exposure to disinfectants, these cover hazards from cleaning - for example dust from animals - diseases such as leptospirosis, and cleaning in confined spaces.</p>

<h2 id="exotic-disease-control-contingency-plans">Exotic disease control contingency plans</h2>

<p>Exotic diseases are those not normally found in the UK, such as avian influenza and zoonoses. By contrast, endemic diseases - such as tuberculosis in cattle - are always present. Both types are notifiable to the Animal Health agency.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> has prepared a framework contingency plan to control exotic animal diseases with significant health or economic impact, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>foot and mouth disease</li>
  <li>avian influenza</li>
  <li>Newcastle disease</li>
  <li>classical swine fever</li>
</ul>
<p>The government’s contingency plan includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>an alert system for signs of notifiable diseases</li>
  <li>a notification map of disease outbreaks</li>
  <li>strategic, tactical and operational procedures</li>
  <li>a National Disease Control Centre coordinating role</li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice signs of any notifiable disease in your livestock, you must report them immediately to your local Animal Health Office (<abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="avian-notifiable-measures">Avian notifiable measures</h2>

<p>Poultry farmers should be alert for signs of notifiable avian diseases, eg avian influenza (bird flu) and Newcastle disease, and should report signs immediately to their vet and local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="control-of-fresh-meat-during-an-animal-disease-outbreak">Control of fresh meat during an animal disease outbreak</h2>

<p>Fresh meat products are subject to special control measures during outbreaks of animal diseases, under the Products of Animal Origin (Disease Control) (England) Regulations 2008.</p>

<p>The regulations cover the following diseases:</p>

<ul>
<li>African swine fever</li>
  <li>classical swine fever</li>
  <li>Newcastle disease</li>
  <li>peste des petits ruminants (sheep and goat plague)</li>
  <li>rinderpest</li>
  <li>swine vesicular disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Separate regulations apply to cases of foot and mouth disease and avian influenza.</p>

<p>Animal Health officers can designate premises as affected by disease. Alternatively, the food business operator - the person responsible for compliance with the requirements of food laws - can apply for a designation.</p>

<p>Meat from establishments where a disease outbreak is suspected or confirmed may not enter the human food chain. Instead, it must be disposed of by slaughterhouses as a Category 2 animal by-product, ie high-risk material containing potential contamination.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/dealing-with-animal-by-products">dealing with animal by-products</a>.</p>

<h3 id="meat-from-protection-and-surveillance-zones">Meat from protection and surveillance zones</h3>

<p>Meat from animals in protection or surveillance zones is classed as ‘restricted meat’. It must be kept separate from other meat products, and is subject to special hygiene and labelling regulations.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/control/meat/pzsz.htm">Find out about treatment and movement of restricted meat on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="meat-and-milk-hygiene-measures-during-outbreaks">Meat and milk hygiene measures during outbreaks</h2>

<p>Special hygiene measures apply to meat and milk food products during outbreaks of animal diseases.</p>

<h3 id="meat-hygiene-measures">Meat hygiene measures</h3>

<p>‘Restricted meat’ is meat from animals within the designated protection or surveillance zones. Such meat must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be marked as ‘restricted meat’</li>
  <li>be kept separately from other meat at all times</li>
  <li>be transported separately and only to designated premises</li>
  <li>not be traded or sold in the UK</li>
  <li>not be traded with other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> states</li>
  <li>not be exported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>

<p>Restricted meat can be transported to a designated treatment centre for an approved treatment to make it safe. After treatment, the meat is considered normal and the restricted markings can be removed.</p>

<h3 id="milk-hygiene-measures">Milk hygiene measures</h3>

<p>During disease outbreaks, milk and milk products from affected areas cannot be sold for human consumption or exported.</p>

<p>If cattle show signs of disease, their milk and milk products must be treated and disposed of as Category 2 animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>). The products must be collected and transported in leak-proof covered vehicles and kept separately from other <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-employees-from-infection-at-work">Protecting employees from infection at work</h2>

<p>Farming and food processing businesses should take steps to protect their employees from zoonoses - diseases transmissible from animals to humans. There are about 40 potential zoonoses in the UK. Most are mild and tend to clear up naturally. However, some can cause serious health problems and are notifiable, which means you must report them to your local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local Animal Health Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Notifiable zoonoses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>anthrax</li>
  <li>avian influenza</li>
  <li>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</li>
  <li>brucellosis</li>
  <li>equine viral encephalomyelitis</li>
  <li>glanders and farcy</li>
  <li>rabies</li>
  <li>rift valley fever</li>
  <li>tuberculosis</li>
  <li>West Nile virus</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-notifiable zoonoses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>coxiella - causing Q fever</li>
  <li>chlamydia - causing pscittacosis/ovine chlamydiosis</li>
  <li>toxoplasma - causing toxoplasmosis</li>
  <li>orf - skin disease of sheep</li>

<h3 id="protection-from-bovine-tuberculosis">Protection from bovine tuberculosis</h3>

<p>There are three main ways by which bovine tuberculosis (<abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr>) can be transmitted to humans:</p>

<ul>
<li>drinking raw milk from cows with ‘disseminated <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr>’ - cows with <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> that has spread outside the lungs or which have <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> lesions on udders</li>
  <li>close proximity to animals with <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> lesions in the lungs or infected cattle carcasses</li>
  <li>infection through cuts or abrasions in the skin</li>
