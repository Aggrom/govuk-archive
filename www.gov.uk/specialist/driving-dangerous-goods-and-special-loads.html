<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When dangerous goods are transported by road, an accident could present considerable harm to people and the environment. Spillage of the goods could lead to fires, explosions and chemical poisoning or burning.</p>

<p>Hauliers need to be aware of the laws on transporting dangerous goods by road, and the procedures involved in classifying such goods.</p>

<p>This guide gives an overview of these rules. It also covers how to ensure that the vehicles in which these goods are carried, and their operators, are correctly certified in accordance with international regulations.</p>

<h2 id="the-european-agreement-concerning-the-international-carriage-of-dangerous-goods-by-road">The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road</h2>

<p>Moving dangerous goods by road is governed by international regulations and is strictly policed. Most European countries are signed up to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (<abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>). Each country which adheres to <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> implements specific safety measures through its own national legislation.</p>

<p>The purpose of <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> is to ensure that dangerous goods - including clinical and other dangerous waste - being carried by road are able to cross international borders freely, as long as goods, vehicles and drivers comply with its provisions. <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> has been in force since 1968 and is administered by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (<abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)">UNECE</abbr>). It is updated every two years to take account of technological advances. On 1 January 2011, <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> 2011 replaced <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> 2009, with any changes applying as of July 2011.</p>

<p><abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> sets out the requirements for classifying, packaging, labelling and certifying dangerous goods. These requirements are set out in Annex A to <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>. Vehicles carrying dangerous goods must comply with the provisions of Annex B to <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>, which includes vehicle and tank specifications and other operational requirements. The drivers of all vehicles (including those with a gross vehicle weight of 3.5 tonnes or less) carrying dangerous goods must have an <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> training certificate. There are exemptions for drivers carrying small loads below the threshold limits, drivers carrying dangerous goods packed in limited quantities, and drivers carrying dangerous goods packed in accepted quantities. </p>

<p>You are required to register as a waste carrier in order to carry certain types of dangerous waste. </p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?AF=A10075&amp;Action=Book&amp;ProductId=9789211391312">purchase <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> 2009 on the Stationery Office bookshop website</a>.</p>

<p>If you transport loads of dangerous goods below certain volume or weight thresholds, many parts of <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> may not apply, or only apply in a modified form. General exemptions to <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> are listed in Chapter 1.1.3. Part 3 of Annex A to <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> includes the dangerous goods list, special provisions and exemptions related to dangerous goods packed in limited quantities.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/cdg">Read about UK regulations concerning the carriage of dangerous goods on the Health &amp; safety Executive (<abbr title="Health &amp; safety Executive (HSE)">HSE</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="in-which-countries-does-adr-apply">In which countries does <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> apply?</h3>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/country-info_e.htm">find a full list of the competent authorities applying <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> on the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)">UNECE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-required-in-order-to-carry-dangerous-goods">Documentation required in order to carry dangerous goods</h2>

<p>When transporting dangerous goods internationally under the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (<abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>), you must ensure your consignments are always accompanied by a transport document. This sets out detailed information on the load being carried, including full classification of the substance(s) carried and how it is packaged. You must present the required information in a certain order and follow certain rules on language.</p>

<p>In addition to documents required under other regulations, under <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> you must ensure that the following documents are carried on the transport unit:</p>

<ul>
<li>transport document(s) containing prescribed information for each dangerous substance, material or article being carried - eg their UN number, their technical name in brackets in addition to the name under which they are being shipped</li>
  <li>emergency instructions in writing</li>
  <li>means of identification, including a photograph for each member of the vehicle crew</li>
</ul>
<p>For full documentation instructions, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/adr2009/English/Part5.pdf">download Part 5 of <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> 2009 from the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)">UNECE</abbr> website (PDF, 765K)</a></p>

<p>In addition, if any part of your journey involves sea transport of the vehicle, see the guide on Moving Goods by Sea.</p>

<h3 id="emergency-instructions-in-writing">Emergency instructions in writing</h3>

<p>The consignor of a vehicle carrying dangerous goods must provide the driver with details of the hazards associated with their dangerous goods loads and instructions on emergency action to take if an accident occurs. These instructions are in the form of an international Transport Emergency Card, known as a ‘Tremcard’. You can <a rel="external" href="http://the-ncec.com/tremcards/">find out about Tremcards on the National Chemical Emergency Centre website</a>.</p>

<p>A new <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> comes into force every two years and allows the previous <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> to continue to apply during the first six months of the new period. <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> 2009, for example, introduced the following changes on 1 January 2009 and they fully applied as of 1 July 2009:</p>

<ul>
<li>before a journey commences, the driver/haulier must provide the instructions in writing (rather than the consignor)</li>
  <li>the instructions must be in a language(s) that every member of the vehicle’s driver/crew understand</li>
  <li>one set of instructions - based on a four page model - covers all dangerous goods rather than specific products</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-agreements-and-legislation-which-may-apply-to-dangerous-loads">Other agreements and legislation which may apply to dangerous loads</h3>

<p>Some exceptions, or ‘derogations’ from the provisions of <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> are allowed under certain multilateral agreements. These allow goods to be transported - usually for a fixed period - between or through any of the countries that have signed up to the multilateral agreement. If you are carrying dangerous goods under such an agreement, you must carry a copy of that agreement. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/multi/multi.htm#m85">check whether a multilateral agreement applies to your load and route on the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)">UNECE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You should also check whether other legislation beyond the <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> applies to the dangerous goods you carry - for example, load restrictions on the carriage of petrol.</p>

<h2 id="the-dangerous-goods-vehicle-approval-certificate">The dangerous goods vehicle approval certificate</h2>

<p>If you intend to carry explosives or dangerous goods in tanks by road to or through countries which apply the European Agreement concerning the <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>, you may need to obtain a certificate under Annex B of <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/adr2009/09ContentsE.html">view requirements of <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> 2009 on construction and approval of vehicles on the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)">UNECE</abbr> website</a>. These requirements will change in <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> 2009.</p>

<p>Fixed-tank vehicles, tank-battery vehicles and other vehicles carrying explosives must undergo technical inspection and a certification procedure in their country of registration to make sure that they conform with <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> requirements and to the standard safety regulations in force, eg covering brakes, lighting and steering.</p>

<p>In the UK, vehicles can be inspected at certain Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)">VOSA</abbr>) Goods Vehicle Testing Stations. <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)">VOSA</abbr> issues a certificate of approval, valid for one year, for vehicles, which pass this inspection. Vehicle operators must pay a fee for the inspection.</p>

<h2 id="driver-training-certificates-required-under-adr">Driver training certificates required under <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Under the European Agreement concerning the <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>, drivers of vehicles with tanks and certain tank components, and some drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods in packages, are required to hold a special vocational certificate of training, sometimes referred to informally as an ‘<abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> Certificate’.</p>

<p>All drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods must attend an approved basic training course. These courses equip drivers with information and tools so that they:</p>

<ul>
<li>are aware of the hazards arising in the carriage of dangerous goods</li>
  <li>can take steps to reduce the likelihood of an incident taking place</li>
  <li>can take all necessary measures for their own safety and that of the public and the environment to limit the effects of any incident that does occur</li>

<h2 id="the-adr-test-required-to-certify-vehicles-used-to-transport-dangerous-goods">The <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> test required to certify vehicles used to transport dangerous goods</h2>

<p>Vehicles used to transport dangerous or hazardous goods must undergo annual checks in order to certify that they are roadworthy.</p>

<p>Certain dangerous goods vehicles must have an extra test and certificate over and above the normal heavy goods vehicle roadworthiness test. This is known informally as an ‘<abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> test’. It ensures that vehicles comply with Part 9 of the European Agreement concerning the <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>. Vehicle requirements vary according to the nature of the goods being carried.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-book-your-annual-adr-dangerous-goods-vehicle-test">How to book your annual <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> Dangerous Goods Vehicle Test</h3>

<p>Dangerous goods vehicle tests can be done at all Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)">VOSA</abbr>) test stations. An <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> vehicle test can be carried out at the same time as the annual test, and an extra fee is payable for this.

<h2 id="requirements-for-the-carriage-of-dangerous-goods-on-vehicles-at-sea">Requirements for the carriage of dangerous goods on vehicles at sea</h2>

<p>The carriage of dangerous goods in vehicles on ships is governed in UK law by the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods and Marine Pollutants) Regulations 1997. These regulations enact the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code established by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The IMDG Code covers the carriage of goods, which have been classified as dangerous if transported by sea, or are a marine pollutant.</p>

<p>The ‘Blue Book’ referred to in previous guidance no longer exists. It has been replaced by Merchant Shipping Notices (MSNs), which are issued by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA)">MCA</abbr>). MSNs cover mandatory information that must be complied with under UK legislation. These MSNs relate to legal requirements and contain the technical detail of such regulations.</p>

<p>For example, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-mnotice.htm?textobjid=3445435023A18525">read about amendment 34-08 to the IMDG Code relating to the carriage of dangerous goods and marine pollutants in packaged form on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA)">MCA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-for-packing-dangerous-cargo-in-freight-containers">Guidelines for packing dangerous cargo in freight containers</h3>

<p>The IMO publishes guidelines for packing cargo in freight containers or vehicles, as a supplement to the IMDG Code. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.imo.org/Safety/mainframe.asp?topic_id=158#4">read about the code together with its supplements on the IMO website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="appointing-a-dangerous-goods-safety-adviser">Appointing a Dangerous Goods Safety Adviser</h2>

<p>To comply with the European Agreement concerning the <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> companies engaged in carrying, packing, filling, loading and/or unloading of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways may have to appoint a Dangerous Goods Safety Adviser (DGSA).</p>

<p>The cases in which this requirement applies are set out in Chapter 1.8.3 of <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr>, which also explains the role of the DGSA.</p>

<p>In the UK, the <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> requirements for appointing a DGSA are enforced under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.</p>

<h2 id="carrying-perishable-foodstuffs-in-road-vehicles">Carrying perishable foodstuffs in road vehicles</h2>

<p>If you carry perishable foodstuffs abroad in an insulated refrigerated vehicle or container, many countries require you to comply with the Agreement on the international carriage of perishable foodstuffs and special equipment to be used for such carriage (<abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr>). If you own or operate a vehicle to transport perishable foodstuffs across international borders between countries that are signatories to <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr>, you must have an <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr> certificate for that vehicle. <a rel="external" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/main/wp11/atp.html">Read the provisions of the <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr> on the United Nations <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)">UNECE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>In general, <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr>’s provisions prescribe the norms and standards for:  </p>

<ul>
<li>preserving the quality of perishable foodstuffs during their international transport - ie are the goods insulated, refrigerated, mechanically refrigerated or heated as appropriate?</li>
  <li>the special transport equipment required</li>
  <li>checking that insulation is appropriate and intact</li>
  <li>distinguishing marks to be affixed to the special equipment</li>
  <li>the equipment and temperature conditions for deep-frozen and frozen foodstuffs</li>
</ul>
<p>A new model <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr> certificate and a revised index apply as of 2 January 2011. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/main/wp11/wp11fdoc/ATP-2010e.pdf">download the agreement and annexes which incorporate the 2011 changes from the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)">UNECE</abbr> website (PDF, 692K)</a>.</p>

<p>Your vehicle or container must carry a certificate or plate to show that it meets the standards for refrigeration and thermal efficiency laid down in the <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr>. Checks on the certificate or plate may be made at borders or inside the countries concerned.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr> certificate is issued following an inspection of the vehicle or container by a ‘Designated Station’. In the UK, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, on behalf of the Department for Transport, has approved Cambridge Refrigeration Technology as a ‘Designated Station’. They are authorised to test, examine, and certify vehicles and containers in accordance with the <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information - including a list of <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr> member countries, <a rel="external" href="http://www.transportoffice.gov.uk/crt/repository/ATP%20Guide.pdf">download <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)">VOSA</abbr>’s guide to <abbr title="Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs">ATP</abbr> (PDF, 50K)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inspection-of-tanks-used-to-carry-dangerous-goods-by-road">Inspection of tanks used to carry dangerous goods by road</h2>

<p>Before an <abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR)">ADR</abbr> vehicle inspection is carried out, fixed tanks, demountable tanks, vehicles carrying batteries of receptacles and tank containers must be examined and tested by an inspection body approved by the UK Department for Transport (DfT). To get the appropriate certificates, your tank equipment will have to meet certain design, construction and equipment standards.</p>
