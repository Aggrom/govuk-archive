<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Chemical manufacturing businesses handle and use hazardous substances, which can harm the environment. The chemical industry includes producers of commodity chemicals such as organic and inorganic chemicals and industrial gases, and speciality chemicals such as pharmaceutical products and essential oils. It also includes mixing, blending, diluting or converting basic chemicals to make chemical products and preparations, eg paints, pesticides, inks, detergents and cosmetics.</p>

<p>Hazardous substances from your business can cause pollution if you do not deal with them correctly. You must comply with any restrictions when you manufacture or use chemicals or chemical products that contain hazardous substances. Using hazardous substances efficiently can help you reduce waste and minimise costs.</p>

<p>This guide explains your legal obligations if you manufacture chemicals or chemical products that contain hazardous substances. It also describes your responsibilities if you use or transport hazardous substances such as solvents, oils, ozone-depleting substances (<abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr>) and fluorinated gases (<abbr title="fluorinated gases">F-gases</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="restrictions-on-using-hazardous-chemicals">Restrictions on using hazardous chemicals</h2>

<p>If you manufacture chemicals or chemical products that contain hazardous or dangerous substances, you must control their risks to human health and the environment. There are restrictions on marketing some chemical substances and how you use them.</p>

<h3 id="comply-with-restrictions">Comply with restrictions</h3>

<p>You must comply with any restrictions that may be placed on chemicals when they are shown to cause harm to human health or the environment. You might use restricted chemicals in manufacturing chemical products or preparations such as paints, varnishes, cosmetics, pesticides, soaps and detergents. You should regularly review the hazardous substances you use and where possible use less harmful alternatives.</p>

<p>Annex XVII of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>) Regulation places restrictions on marketing or using certain chemical substances and preparations, or both.</p>

<p>You must comply with a restriction regardless of how much of a chemical you market or use. You will be committing an offence if you fail to comply with the conditions of a restriction.</p>

<p>A restriction may:</p>

<ul>
<li>ban the use of a chemical for a specific activity or purpose</li>
  <li>set a concentration limit for a specific activity or purpose</li>
  <li>apply to all users or just to specific uses, eg exceptions may exist for some professional or industrial uses</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples-of-chemical-restrictions">Examples of chemical restrictions</h3>

<p>Chemicals restricted or banned from marketing or use include:</p>

<ul>
<li>organotin compounds (including tributyltin [<abbr title="tributyltin">TBT</abbr>], triphenyltin [<abbr title="triphenyltin">TPT</abbr>] and dioctyltin [<abbr title="dioctyltin">DOT</abbr>]) for use in some mixtures and articles in concentrations greater than 0.1% - including in some textile products worn next to the skin, gloves and footwear and female hygiene products, and in some adhesive and plastic products, eg guttering</li>
  <li>dibutyltin hydrogen borate (di-u-oxo-di-n-butylstanniohydroxyborane [<abbr title="di-u-oxo-di-n-butylstanniohydroxyborane">DBB</abbr>]) in substances and mixtures in concentrations greater than 0.1% - including in some glass coatings</li>
  <li>nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylate in concentrations of 0.1% or more for most industrial, institutional and domestic cleaning products and pesticide and cosmetic products</li>
  <li>organic solvents above limit values in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products</li>
  <li>pentachlorophenol (<abbr title="pentachlorophenol">PCP</abbr>) in substances and mixtures in concentrations greater than 0.1%</li>
  <li>polychlorinated biphenyls (<abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>) and polychlorinated terphenyls (<abbr title="polychlorinated terphenyls">PCTs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>pesticides that contain certain active substances, such as endosulfan and <abbr title="tributyltin">TBT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>detergents and cosmetics that contain fragrance ingredients that could cause allergies</li>
  <li>some chlorinated solvents including 1,1,2 trichloroethane, chloroform and dichloromethane (<abbr title="dichloromethane">DCM</abbr>) - including <abbr title="dichloromethane">DCM</abbr> in concentrations of greater than 0.1% in paint strippers</li>
  <li>substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic and/or toxic for reproduction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="check-if-a-chemical-is-restricted">Check if a chemical is restricted</h3>

<p>Annex XVII of <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> is subject to change. You should check it regularly to keep up to date with restrictions on the chemicals you work with.</p>

<p>To find Annex XVII, search the European law database using the terms ‘<abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>’ with ‘Annex XVII’ and select ‘Title’ under Options. <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/SuiteLegislation.do?T1=V111&amp;T2=V1&amp;T3=V1&amp;RechType=RECH_legislation&amp;Submit=Search">Find the European law database on the Europa website.</a></p>

<p>If your chemicals are classed as persistent organic pollutants (<abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>) you must comply with international controls on their production, use and disposal. </p>

<p>You must use a chemical substance within its safe exposure limits. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/registration-evaluation-authorisation-and-restriction-of-chemicals"><abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr></a></p>

<p>You may also have obligations under other legislation about the chemicals you use in your products, for example to control and protect user safety and human health in cosmetic products. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/product-safety">Find consumer and product safety information on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills website.</a></p>

<h3 id="apply-for-chemical-authorisations">Apply for chemical authorisations</h3>

<p><abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> identifies some substances with known high risks to human health or the environment as substances of very high concern. These substances have further restrictions on their use.</p>

<p>You may need to get an authorisation from the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) to market or use these substances for specific uses.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/registration-evaluation-authorisation-and-restriction-of-chemicals"><abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr></a></p>

<h3 id="other-limits-on-hazardous-substances">Other limits on hazardous substances</h3>

<p>If you manufacture biocidal products, or supply a chemical to be used as an active substance, these must be approved before they can be sold or used. Biocidal products include disinfectants for home and industrial use, preservatives or pest control products. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1086778448">pesticides and biocides - your environmental responsibilities.</a></p>

<p>If your business manufactures, recycles, imports, exports or rebrands electrical or electronic equipment (<abbr title="electrical or electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>) you must limit the amount of certain hazardous substances in new equipment. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/restriction-of-the-use-of-certain-hazardous-substances-in-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-rohs">restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment">RoHS</abbr>).</a></p>

<p>If your business manufactures or imports batteries, or machinery or <abbr title="electrical or electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> containing batteries, you must limit the amount of cadmium and mercury contained in new batteries. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1084689628">batteries - your responsibilities.</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-classify-and-label-chemicals">How to classify and label chemicals</h2>

<p>The Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations (<abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations">CHIP</abbr>) regulate how chemicals must be classified, labelled and packaged. Certain products, for example medicines, food and cosmetics, are exempt from <abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations">CHIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>How you classify, label and package your chemicals is changing as the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (<abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr>) takes effect. <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr> introduces the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (<abbr title="Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals">GHS</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you manufacture or supply chemical substances, products or mixtures, you must classify and label them according to <abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations">CHIP</abbr> before you put them on the market. Since 1 December 2010 you must also have been using <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr> for some activities.</p>

<h3 id="classify-your-chemicals">Classify your chemicals</h3>

<p>You must determine whether chemicals or chemical products (eg paints or inks) you manufacture or supply are hazardous. This process is known as classification.</p>

<p>You must identify what kind of hazards your chemical or product has, including its physical and chemical properties, its effects on human health and what happens to it in the environment.</p>

<p>Under <abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations">CHIP</abbr>, chemical hazard classifications include:</p>

<ul>
<li>explosive</li>
  <li>oxidising</li>
  <li>flammable</li>
  <li>toxic</li>
  <li>irritant</li>
  <li>corrosive</li>
  <li>dangerous for the environment</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr> covers a similar range of hazards although it introduces new hazard classes and categories.</p>

<h3 id="label-your-chemicals">Label your chemicals</h3>

<p>If the chemicals or chemical products you manufacture or supply are classified as hazardous, you must tell users about the hazards and how they can use the chemical or product safely to help protect themselves and the environment.</p>

<p>You must package and label your chemical or chemical product with appropriate hazard warning labels. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/chip/phrases.htm">Find hazard warning information on the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h3 id="changes-to-how-you-classify-and-label-chemicals">Changes to how you classify and label chemicals</h3>

<p>You must now use both <abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations">CHIP</abbr> and <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr> to classify your substances, including chemical elements (eg arsenic) or compounds (eg acetone). You must label and package your substances according to <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr> only.</p>

<p>You must classify, label and package your substances and mixtures or solutions (eg paints or inks) using <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr> only by 1 June 2015.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/clp/clp_help_en.asp">Read guidance on classification and labelling under the <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures">CLP</abbr> Regulation on the European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notify-echa">Notify <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you are a chemical manufacturer or importer, you may need to notify <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> if you place a hazardous substance on the market by itself or in a mixture no matter what the quantity.</p>

<p>Manufacturers and importers may also need to notify <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> about substances which have to be registered under the <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> Regulation.</p>

<p>You must notify <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> within one month of placing a substance on the market.

<h2 id="transporting-dangerous-goods-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Transporting dangerous goods responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Your business may need to transport dangerous substances, such as chemical substances, by road or rail. You will need to manage the risk of spills during carriage, which could lead to fire, explosions or environmental damage.</p>

<h3 id="identify-hazards">Identify hazards</h3>

<p>If you transport dangerous goods by road and rail, you must comply with certain legal requirements that are principally enforced by the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are different classes of dangerous goods including:</p>

<ul>
<li>corrosive substances</li>
  <li>explosive substances and articles</li>
  <li>flammable liquids</li>
  <li>flammable solids</li>
  <li>gases</li>
  <li>oxidising substances</li>
  <li>radioactive substances</li>
  <li>toxic substances</li>
</ul>
<p>You have a responsibility to identify the hazards of the goods you intend to transport, and meet further requirements for packaging, labelling and documentation.</p>

<p>There are some exemptions from the full requirements for the transport of certain goods packed as limited quantities or limited loads. An example of a limited quantity could be the delivery of small dangerous goods such as non-toxic aerosol products of up to 1 litre in size and packed in shrink or stretch-wrapped trays up to a gross mass of 20 kilograms.</p>

<p>You can email the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) dangerous goods division for specific operational queries. <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/freight/dgt1/road/contactus/contactdg">Find <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> contact details on the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="transport-hazardous-chemicals-and-hazardous-waste-correctly">Transport hazardous chemicals and hazardous waste correctly</h3>

<p>If you import chemical substances or preparations into the European Union, you may need to register them with the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/registration-evaluation-authorisation-and-restriction-of-chemicals"><abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If your business produces hazardous waste, you must comply with legal obligations that control how you transport it. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1080466581">managing your hazardous waste.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>Ensure your drivers have adequate instruction and training to understand the hazards of the goods they are transporting and what to do in an emergency. If an incident occurs, you can call the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 to report an incident and ask for help and advice about what to do.</p>

<p>Ensure all your goods are transported in suitable containers and are labelled correctly. They should be contained securely to prevent damage or spills. Carry out routine inspection and maintenance of your containers.</p>

<p>If you transport oil or fuel in tankers you should not then use the tankers to store oil as they are not designed for oil storage. </p>

<p>Avoid leaks or releases from valves and container doors, as these can be sources of spills, odour, dust or vapour emissions.</p>

<p>When carrying dangerous or polluting materials, avoid travelling through environmentally sensitive areas where possible.</p>

<p>Make sure that drivers responsible for carrying goods supervise the loading of their vehicles. Before any loading is carried out, the driver should check containers to ensure they are not leaking and that caps and lids are secure.</p>

<p>Make sure that your vehicles do not have any parts which stick out into the load-carrying area as these could damage containers or packages. The load-carrying area should have solid, impermeable surfaces free from pockets or seams. This will make it easier to clean.</p>

<p>Carry absorbent materials, impermeable sealable containers and other pollution control equipment (eg grab packs and spill kits) suitable for the type of substance you are transporting. Absorbent materials used to contain spills may require separate recycling or disposal as hazardous waste. Check before you recycle or dispose of them.</p>

<h2 id="fuel-and-oil-use-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Fuel and oil use responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Your chemical manufacturing business might use and store fuel and oil for equipment and vehicles used on site.</p>

<p>Leaks and spills cause pollution, so it is essential that you store and handle fuels and oil safely. Fuels include petrol, diesel, oil and liquid petroleum gas (<abbr title="liquid petroleum gas">LPG</abbr>).</p>

<p>You may use oils as:</p>

<ul>
<li>a fuel</li>
  <li>a raw material, eg paraffin</li>
  <li>a solvent, eg toluene</li>
  <li>lubricating oil for vehicles and machinery, eg mineral or synthetic oils and greases</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="store-oil-safely">Store oil safely</h3>

<p>If you store any kind of oil on your premises, you may need to comply with a number of regulations controlling its storage. This will depend on how much and what type of oil you store, the type of site you have and the containers you use.</p>

<p>Even if oil storage controls do not apply, you should still store your oils responsibly and consider meeting the requirements of the legislation. This can help you to prevent land and water pollution and avoid prosecution.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1080454826">storing oil.</a></p>

<h3 id="prevent-major-accidents">Prevent major accidents</h3>

<p>If you store or use dangerous substances, such as petroleum products or <abbr title="liquid petroleum gas">LPG</abbr>, on your site, you may need to comply with the Control of Major Accident Hazards (<abbr title="control of major accident hazards">COMAH</abbr>) Regulations.</p>

<p>For example, if you store more than 2,500 tonnes of petroleum products, you must have a major accident prevention policy. If you store more than 25,000 tonnes of petroleum products you must also submit a safety report and prepare an on-site emergency plan.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1086692210"><abbr title="control of major accident hazards">COMAH</abbr></a></p>

<h3 id="supervise-refuelling">Supervise refuelling</h3>

<p>Supervise all fuel deliveries to your site.</p>

<p>Clearly label all tanks with their contents and storage capacity. You should also label remote filling points. This will reduce the risk of overfilling and spills.</p>

<p>Use drip trays when you refuel mobile or temporary equipment, for example bowsers or generators, and at the fill point when refilling storage tanks. This may be a legal requirement. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1080454826">storing oil.</a></p>

<p>Prevent water running off refuelling areas into surface water drains and general yard drainage by using drainage gullies, raised kerbs or appropriate falls. Drain this run-off via an oil separator. You may need permission from the Environment Agency or your water and sewerage company to discharge wastewater from your oil interceptor.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0406BIYL-e-e.pdf?lang=_e">Download Pollution prevention guideline: Use and design of oil separators in surface water drainage systems (PPG3) from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 79KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure your oil separator is properly maintained and works effectively. If your oil separator doesn’t work properly, you might cause pollution, and you could be prosecuted or fined.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-drainage-system-incidents">Prevent drainage system incidents</h3>

<p>Keep an up-to-date and accurate drainage plan of your site. This will help you identify the locations of all the drains and sewers and where they lead.</p>

<p>When making a discharge to a drain or sewer, always check you are connecting to the correct system. You should only discharge clean, uncontaminated surface water to the surface water drainage system.</p>

<p>Colour code your drainage system by painting manhole covers, gullies and grills using a recognised colour coding system - blue for surface water drains and red for foul water drains. This will help you to identify which system you are discharging to and where any spills will end up.</p>

<p>Install shut-off valves on your surface and foul water drainage lines so that you can isolate your site drainage if there is a major fuel spill.</p>

<p>Report any pollution incidents as soon as they happen to the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60.</p>

<h2 id="solvent-use-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Solvent use responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Organic solvents used in chemical manufacturing produce emissions that can harm the environment and human health.</p>

<p>Organic solvents are volatile organic compounds (<abbr title="volatile organic compounds">VOCs</abbr>), which are chemicals that easily vaporise at room temperature and may be harmful if inhaled. They are used for a variety of purposes including:</p>

<ul>
<li>dissolving materials</li>
  <li>cleaning</li>
  <li>manufacturing products such as paints, adhesives, inks, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and toiletries and pesticides</li>
  <li>extracting natural essences for manufacturing essential oils</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="check-if-you-need-a-permit">Check if you need a permit</h3>

<p>If you use organic solvents, you may require an environmental permit from the Environment Agency or your local authority. If you have a permit you must comply with its conditions, which may require you to reduce or control your solvent emissions.</p>

<p>You will need a permit for solvent emissions if you use:</p>

<ul>
<li>more than 100 tonnes per year of a solvent-based product for manufacturing coating preparations, varnishes, inks and adhesives</li>
  <li>more than 50 tonnes per year of a solvent-based product for manufacturing pharmaceutical products</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce solvent use during production and processing you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep containers closed when you are not using them - this may also save you money by reducing loss of materials through evaporation</li>
  <li>use properly covered or closed mixing vessels - you could consider fully enclosed mixing systems</li>
  <li>pass the vessel mixer shaft through the smallest hole possible</li>
  <li>ensure all equipment seals fit properly and are in good condition</li>
  <li>use a piped or pumped system to introduce materials into mixing vessels rather than chutes</li>
  <li>use automatic metering - this will help you obtain accurate quantities</li>
  <li>use computer-controlled dispensing systems to avoid overfilling product containers</li>
  <li>reuse or recover your waste solvents - ask your supplier if they offer a solvent reclamation service</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce the risk of harmful chemical emissions you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>regularly review the solvents you use to determine if there are lower <abbr title="volatile organic compounds">VOC</abbr> alternatives</li>
  <li>fit mixing vessel lids with interlocks so you can switch off your extraction system when the lid is closed</li>

<h2 id="detergent-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Detergent responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Detergents are chemical substances containing soaps and surfactants that are used for washing and cleaning and can be in any form: powder, tablet, liquid or paste.</p>

<p>They can have significant impacts on the water environment, releasing organic chemicals which can be toxic to fish and other aquatic life. Ingredients may also not readily break down and cause long-lasting pollution in the environment.</p>

<h3 id="label-your-detergent-products">Label your detergent products</h3>

<p>If you manufacture or place on the market any detergents you must include certain information on the label of your products including the name and trade name of the detergent and your business name, address and phone number.</p>

<p>You must also include the basic ingredients of the detergent. You do not need to include precise formula details. All ingredients with a concentration above 0.2% must be listed in percentage ranges. Fragrances, enzymes, optical brighteners and disinfectants must be listed on the product label in any concentration.</p>

<p>You must provide information on the label in English.</p>

<h3 id="list-your-detergent-ingredients">List your detergent ingredients</h3>

<p>You must produce a detailed list of the ingredients in your detergents as part of the product’s <abbr title="Safety Data Sheet">SDS</abbr>. This must be available on request to health professionals treating allergies. The information will be kept confidential.</p>

<p>You should provide a basic version of this list on the internet. If you do not have a website your trade association may be able to include it on their website. <a rel="external" href="http://www.taforum.org/">Find information on trade associations on the Trade Association Forum website.</a></p>

<h3 id="ensure-your-surfactants-are-biodegradable">Ensure your surfactants are biodegradable</h3>

<p>Surfactants are active ingredients which help a detergent or cleaning product remove dirt from surfaces. If you manufacture detergents containing surfactants for domestic users, you must ensure that the surfactants are ultimately biodegradable and so are easily broken down by bacteria into harmless chemicals.</p>

<p>If you manufacture detergents containing surfactants for industrial or institutional users which are not ultimately biodegradable, you can apply for a derogation (permission to carry out an otherwise banned activity) from the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (<abbr title="Chemicals Regulation Directorate">CRD</abbr>), part of the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>. To do so, you must ensure that your product passes the minimum legal standards for primary biodegradability.</p>

<p>Primary biodegradability is the first stage in the breaking-down of surfactants, after which they are usually less dangerous to the living environment.</p>

<p>You must keep the results of surfactant biodegradability testing which must be available to the <abbr title="Chemicals Regulation Directorate">CRD</abbr>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/guidance/industries/pesticides/topics/detergents">Find guidance on complying with detergent legislation on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="check-restricted-chemicals">Check restricted chemicals</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> Regulation places restrictions on marketing and using certain chemical substances and preparations, including some surfactants.</p>

<p>You should check the ingredients used in your detergent or cleaning product against Annex XVII of the <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> Regulation which contains a list of restricted chemicals and their restrictions and concentration limits. </p>

<p>From 1 January 2015 you must not manufacture or put on the market domestic laundry cleaning products (<abbr title="domestic laundry cleaning products">DLCPs</abbr>) containing more than 0.4% of their weight of inorganic phosphates. A proposal by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> could see the ban on phosphates in <abbr title="domestic laundry cleaning products">DLCPs</abbr> come into force from 1 January 2013.</p>

<abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POP</abbr> controls</h3>

<p>You must not produce, market or use <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> unless your use is allowed under Annex I or II of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> Regulation. There are general exemptions if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you only use a substance classed as a <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POP</abbr> for research and development</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> are in a substance, preparation or article as an unintentional trace contaminant</li>
</ul>
<p>You must notify the Environment Agency if you have more than 50 kilograms of <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>, or substances containing <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>, allowed by an exemption.</p>

<p>If you have any stores of <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>, or substances or articles (including equipment) containing <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>, and the material is not covered by an exemption, it is classed as waste and you must dispose of them correctly as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/36748.aspx">Find information on dealing with <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h3 id="avoid-releasing-pops-from-industrial-processes">Avoid releasing <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> from industrial processes</h3>

<p>You must avoid the unplanned release of <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> such as dioxins, HCB, <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> and <abbr title="Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons">PAHs</abbr> from industrial activities, or from burning material and fuels. These are the most common <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> in the environment.</p>

<p><abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> are only likely to be released from industrial activities that require a Part A(1) environmental permit. You must comply with the conditions in your permit, which will include requirements for controlling <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POP</abbr> releases.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-chemical-manufacturing">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for chemical manufacturing.</a></p>

<h3 id="deal-with-waste-containing-pops-correctly">Deal with waste containing <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> correctly</h3>

<p>If a material, waste or piece of equipment has a <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POP</abbr> concentration at or above the thresholds stated in Annex IV of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> Regulation, you must dispose of it in accordance with Annex V so the <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POP</abbr> content is destroyed or permanently changed, for example by high temperature incineration.</p>

<p>If a material, waste or piece of equipment contains any concentration of <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>, it may be hazardous waste. This will place additional requirements on how you store, transport and dispose of it. You will need to assess the level of contaminants in your waste and dispose of it safely. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1080466581">managing your hazardous waste.</a></p>

<p>In most cases it is illegal to export <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="apply-for-permission-to-dispose-of-certain-wastes-containing-pops">Apply for permission to dispose of certain wastes containing <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you wish to dispose of waste that contains <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> by permanent secure storage you must obtain a derogation (permission to carry out an otherwise banned activity) from the Environment Agency. This only applies to certain waste streams, for example wastes from thermal processes. You will be charged a fee for any derogation application and you will have to meet certain strict conditions to get approval.</p>

<h3 id="pcbs-in-equipment">
<abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> in equipment</h3>

<p><abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> are classed as <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>. If you have any equipment containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> you will need to meet a number of other requirements. </p>

<h3 id="pops-regulation-guidance-and-annexes">

<p>This guidance is under review and does not include information about the most recently added <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> - tetra-, penta-, hexa- and hepta- bromodiphenyl ether and <abbr title="perfluorooctane sulfonic acid">PFOS</abbr> and its derivatives. If you have any questions about these substances you should contact the Environment Agency’s chemical compliance team. You can email them at <a href="mailto:chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk">chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk.</a></p>

<h2 id="polychlorinated-biphenyl-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Polychlorinated biphenyl responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p><abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> are man-made chemicals. They are dangerous to human health and the environment and you must dispose of them correctly and in most cases as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Using <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> to make electrical equipment and related products is now banned. If you have equipment made in Europe before 1987 it may contain <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>. Older equipment that could contain <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>electrical transformers</li>
  <li>power factor capacitors</li>
  <li>heat transfer equipment</li>
  <li>pole-mounted transformers</li>
  <li>process heating equipment</li>
  <li>high temperature hydraulic systems</li>
  <li>electrical resistors</li>
  <li>bushings and other high voltage equipment</li>
  <li>fluorescent light ballasts</li>
  <li>hospital diagnostic equipment</li>
  <li>vacuum pumps</li>
</ul>
<p>Some chemical and combustion processes may also release <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> accidentally if fuels or feedstocks (raw materials required for an industrial process) are contaminated. You can avoid <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> contamination by managing and disposing of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> wastes properly.</p>

<h3 id="deal-with-equipment-containing-pcbs-safely">Deal with equipment containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> safely</h3>

<p>You must arrange for the safe disposal or decontamination of all equipment that contains more than 50 parts per million (<abbr title="parts per million">ppm</abbr>) of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> as soon as possible, unless you are permitted to continue using it.</p>

<p>If your equipment contains more than five litres of any substance with a <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> concentration greater than 50ppm it is classed as Contaminated Equipment.</p>

<p>You must not possess Contaminated Equipment unless your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses transformers with <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> oil at concentrations of no more than 500ppm. You can continue to use the transformer until the end of its useful life. You should register the equipment with the Environment Agency and renew the registration annually if it contains oil with a <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> concentration at or above 50ppm.</li>
  <li>Uses <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> only for analytical or research work. You must ensure that you dispose of the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> properly when this purpose comes to an end.</li>
  <li>Has the proper authorisation to decontaminate or dispose of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> and holds them only for this reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you possess any equipment with components that contain <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>, and neither the component nor the larger equipment is classed as Contaminated Equipment, you may continue to possess the equipment until it is taken out of use, for example capacitors within fluorescent lighting strips. You must dispose of the equipment correctly at the end of its useful life.</p>

<h3 id="register-contaminated-equipment">Register Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>If you possess Contaminated Equipment you must register it with the Environment Agency, even if you are about to dispose of it. You must also register any equipment that could potentially be Contaminated Equipment unless it is reasonable to assume that it is not contaminated. You must renew your registrations annually for as long as you have the equipment.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/hazsubstances/32000.aspx">Read <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> registration guidance on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h3 id="decontaminate-contaminated-equipment">Decontaminate Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>You should arrange for the safe decontamination of all Contaminated Equipment you have as soon as possible, unless you are permitted to continue using it.</p>

<p>Decontamination reduces the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> concentration of Contaminated Equipment to less than 50ppm. When you submit your registration or renewal paperwork you should tell the Environment Agency how and when you plan to have the decontamination work done.</p>

<h3 id="deregister-contaminated-equipment">Deregister Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>You should deregister your Contaminated Equipment after its disposal, decontamination or sale.</p>

<p>You will need to provide evidence such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>consignment note numbers for both the waste equipment and contaminated oil</li>
  <li>laboratory test reports</li>
  <li>contact details of the new owner</li>
</ul>
<p>Any new owner of your Contaminated Equipment must register it with the Environment Agency.</p>

<h3 id="label-all-contaminated-equipment">Label all Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>You must clearly label all Contaminated Equipment as containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> and place warning notices on the doors of any premises where the equipment is kept. Transformers that are held until the end of their useful life should also have an additional label showing they have been decontaminated to below 500ppm.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1043/schedules/made">Read about labelling decontaminated transformers in Schedule 2 of the Environmental Protection (Disposal of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> and other Dangerous Substances) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 on the Legislation.gov.uk website.</a></p>

<h3 id="dispose-of-waste-or-equipment-containing-pcbs-correctly">Dispose of waste or equipment containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> correctly</h3>

<p>You must dispose of all waste or equipment containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> safely. Wherever possible you should dispose of the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr>-containing component or substance separately from the rest of the equipment.</p>

<p>If your waste contains any concentration of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> it may be hazardous waste. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087520983&amp;topicId=1080466581">managing your hazardous waste.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> are classed as <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> and their production, use and disposal are controlled internationally.</p>

<p>Under the European Union <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> Regulation if your waste or piece of equipment has a <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> concentration above 50 milligrams per kilogram you must dispose of it so the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCB</abbr> content is destroyed or permanently changed, for example by high temperature incineration.</p>
