<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you want to invest in improvements to your fishing vessel, you may be eligible for a grant from the European Fisheries Fund (<abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>). Small-scale coastal fishers (using vessels under 12 metres) may be eligible to receive up to 60 per cent of their costs to improve onboard safety, hygiene or energy efficiency, or to upgrade or replace gear.</p>

<p>Other fishing operations using larger vessels may be able to receive up to 40 per cent of their project costs.</p>

<p>This guide explains what types of businesses and improvement projects are eligible for <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> grant funding, and how to apply.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-a-grant-for-vessel-modernisation">How to get a grant for vessel modernisation</h2>

<p>Grants for vessel modernisation are available to vessel owners in the private sector.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-projects-eligible-for-grants">Types of projects eligible for grants</h3>

<p>The following list will help you to decide whether or not what you want to apply for is eligible for a grant from the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>.</p>

<p>The following can be applied for on the same application form:</p>

<ul>
<li>modernisations to improve onboard safety and working conditions for your employees - for more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/investing-on-board-your-fishing-vessel">improvements to onboard safety and working conditions</a>
</li>
  <li>projects and new equipment to improve product quality and hygiene </li>
  <li>more sustainable fishing gear and methods</li>
</ul>
<p>As a requirement for getting a grant:</p>

<ul>
<li>your vessel must have been on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> fishing vessel register for at least five years</li>
  <li>your vessel must be sound, seaworthy and must otherwise comply with statutory life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and collision regulations, have a current certificate of compliance and be insured</li>
  <li>your home port must be in England</li>
  <li>your vessel must be engaged in the commercial exploitation of fisheries</li>
  <li>replacement gear must be more selective</li>
  <li>the modernisation being funded must not increase your ability to catch fish</li>
  <li>you or any close relative should not have any financial interest in the companies that supply goods or services to your project</li>
  <li>application costs for grant purposes will only be considered in respect of equipment or work listed on the application form</li>
</ul>
<p>If modernisation would lead to an increase in tonnage, you must also agree to have the vessel re-measured after the work has been done, and get the necessary additional licence cover for the changes.</p>

<h3 id="when-you-can-apply-for-a-grant">When you can apply for a grant</h3>

<p>You may apply for a grant for investment in your fishing vessel at any time. Depending on the amount of your grant and how complicated it is, your application form and business case might have to go to a selection panel. These selection panel reviews are normally held three times a year. The Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) publishes details of when the panel meets on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> reserves the right to close the programme earlier if the funds allocated to the programme have been used up. You should also note that the eligibility criteria may be reviewed from time to time during the lifetime of the programme.</p>

<p>For advice, contact the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="improvements-to-onboard-safety-and-working-conditions">Improvements to onboard safety and working conditions</h2>

</ul>
<p>For advice, contact the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="improvements-to-product-quality-and-hygiene">Improvements to product quality and hygiene</h2>

<p>European Fisheries Fund aid will be available for enhancing the ability of vessels to maintain the quality of fish caught, to maximise its value at the point of first marketing. Aid can be granted for fish handling and chilling equipment such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>gutting machines</li>
  <li>ice-making equipment</li>
  <li>packing equipment</li>
  <li>fish washing equipment</li>

</ul>
<p>For advice, call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="improvements-to-fishing-gear-and-methods">Improvements to fishing gear and methods</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> may contribute to the financing of investments to achieve the selectivity of fishing gear, provided that:</p>

<ul>
<li>your fishing vessel is affected by a fishing effort adjustment plan, is changing its fishing method and is leaving the fishery concerned to go to another, better-resourced fishery</li>
  <li>the new gear is more selective and meets recognised environmental criteria, and involves practices which go beyond existing regulatory obligations under European Community law</li>
</ul>
<p>You can modernise or replace your gear or change your method of fishing in favour of more sustainable options. This includes more selective fishing gear to minimise the impact of fishing on fish stocks and the wider marine environment. This might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>handlining</li>
  <li>longlining</li>
  <li>separator trawls</li>
  <li>trawls incorporating sorting and separator grids</li>
  <li>benthic release panels</li>
  <li>pilchard ring netting and other traditional fishing gear that is species specific</li>
  <li>fish traps</li>
  <li>alternative fishing methods which will enable diversification of effort away from pressurised stocks</li>
  <li>equipment to protect gear from wild predators</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improvements-to-energy-efficiency">Improvements to energy efficiency</h3>

<p>Reducing your energy consumption and using the energy you receive more efficiently will save you money. Lower energy costs will improve the bottom line of your business and help you to run a more efficient operation.</p>

<p>Eligible items include:</p>

<ul>
<li>replacing energy inefficient machines and equipment with more fuel efficient technologies</li>
  <li>installing sensors and timer controls to minimise the operation of secondary fans on ventilation systems</li>
  <li>more environmentally friendly fuel systems</li>
  <li>auxiliary motors (until end of 2010), as long as these are not attached to gear or increase your ability to catch fish</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> may also contribute to one replacement engine per vessel, provided that:</p>

<ul>
<li>for fishing vessels of an overall length of less than 12 metres and not using towed gear, the new engine has the same power as the old one or less</li>
  <li>for vessels up to 24 metres in overall length, other than those referred to above, the new engine has at least 20 per cent less power than the old one</li>
  <li>for trawlers of more than 24 metres in overall length, the new engine must have at least 20 per cent less power than the old one, the vessel must be subject to a rescue and restructuring plan and change to a less fuel intensive fishing method</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside your application you will have to provide a copy of the Certificate of Registry to prove the current power output of your vessel’s current engine. Following the replacement, you should submit and copy of the new Certificate of Registry to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> to prove the power reduction in the new engine.</p>

<p>For advice, you can call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="types-of-project-that-are-not-eligible-for-a-grant">Types of project that are not eligible for a grant</h2>

<p>The following items would not normally be eligible for a European Fisheries Fund grant:</p>

<ul>
<li>aquaculture service vessels</li>
  <li>winches where these increase the ability to catch fish</li>
  <li>automatic identification systems</li>
  <li>VAT, except for non-recoverable VAT when it is genuinely and definitively borne by a beneficiary</li>
  <li>running or operating costs</li>
  <li>interest on debt</li>
  <li>projects that started (including delivery of equipment) before the earliest starting date as specified in the offer letter</li>
  <li>transfer of ownership</li>
  <li>equipment you will not own, apart from equipment temporarily needed to put the project in place</li>
  <li>any items on a hire purchase or leasing agreement which have not been paid for in full</li>
  <li>any equipment purchased during the previous seven years with the aid of European Union or national grant which exceeds market value, is not fit for purpose, is not part of a project or does not comply with standards</li>
  <li>any costs of an applicant’s own current or existing labour/staff and equipment unless directly needed to put the project in place</li>
  <li>office equipment and furniture other than computers, software, printers and other communications equipment that are directly associated with or for a new project</li>
  <li>working capital, bank charges or interest</li>
</ul>
<p>For advice, you can call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="being-awarded-a-grant-for-fishing-vessel-improvements">Being awarded a grant for fishing vessel improvements</h2>

<p>The minimum amount of grant you can apply for is £500. If the grant you are applying for is less than £500, your fishermen’s association or producers’ organisation might be able to apply for grants on several items of equipment collectively, which would then be owned by the association or organisation.</p>

<p>For replacement engines, the maximum amount of grant is £100,000. For all other measures, the maximum amount of grant is £60,000. Funds will be awarded to projects demonstrating the best value for money.</p>

<p>The following conditions apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>You cannot receive grant on your project from more than one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> fund. You must therefore confirm on the application form that you have not applied for an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> grant on your project under another scheme.</li>
  <li>Your project must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK legislation.</li>
  <li>Your project must have a funding package which includes match funding from UK public money and private funds.</li>
  <li>Your project should not duplicate existing, or other planned, activity or expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-the-offer-letter-will-contain">What the offer letter will contain</h3>

<p>The offer letter will set out details of the conditions attached to the offer of grant and the agreed performance targets and outputs for the project. You must therefore comply with the targets and conditions contained in the offer letter to enable the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> to pay your claim(s) for grant.</p>

<p>When you receive your offer letter you should check it carefully, sign one copy and return it before you can commence your project. You should do this within four weeks of receipt. After this period the offer will expire.</p>

<p>Details of applications will be treated as commercially confidential throughout the assessment stage. Once your project has been approved, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will make public some details, in particular the name of the successful applicant, the amount of grant approved and the nature of the project to which grant has been awarded. In accepting an offer you will be regarded as having given your consent to this. In any publicity for the project you should acknowledge that you have obtained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> grant on it.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-change-a-project-after-accepting-an-offer-of-grant">How to change a project after accepting an offer of grant</h3>

<p>You can apply for modifications to your project once you have signed the offer letter. However, you must secure approval in writing before implementing any modification to your project. If you do not do this any resulting costs could become ineligible for grant aid.</p>

<p>You should note that if you make any changes to an approved project without the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>’s prior approval, they may revise or cancel the grant award.</p>

  <li>safety equipment additional to that required by Maritime and Coastguard Agency rules</li>
  <li>facilities to maximise fish quality where the costs are less than £1,250</li>

  <li>how you will monitor the project</li>
  <li>how you will manage your risks to delivery</li>
  <li>information about your business - your experience of running similar projects and the results which were achieved, including company accounts for the last three years</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>type of vessel</li>
  <li>type of fishing gear or method</li>

  <li>whether the change in fishing pattern is in response to restrictions on fishing by the European Union, the government or others</li>
  <li>how this change will affect overall fishing effort</li>
