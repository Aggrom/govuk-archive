<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses that trade in goods with other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states are required to provide details of these transactions, which are used for statistical purposes. Intrastat is the system used to collect these statistics.</p>

<p>Movements of goods between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states are called arrivals, or acquisitions; and dispatches, or removals (rather than imports or exports as these terms instead define trade with countries that do not belong to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</p>

<p>All <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses, regardless of their intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> turnover, must show the total value of goods dispatched to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states in box 8 and the total arrivals of goods acquired from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states in box 9 of their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return.</p>

<p>In addition, those who trade in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> above either or both of the Intrastat exemption thresholds must also complete monthly Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>). The 2011 and 2012 annual thresholds are £600,000 for arrivals and £250,000 for dispatches.</p>

<p>Larger businesses that trade above the Intrastat delivery terms threshold of £16 million must also specify delivery terms information on their <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="intrastat-coverage-duties-and-benefits">Intrastat: coverage, duties and benefits</h2>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> collects trade statistics on goods leaving and entering the UK, known as Intrastat, and also provide free online information for traders to complete their Intrastat Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>). The supply of services is excluded from Intrastat.</p>

<p>In addition to direct purchases from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and sales to them, you should declare all intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> goods:</p>

<ul>
<li>transferred within the same legal entity</li>
  <li>sent for or returned after processing</li>
  <li>mixed supplies of goods and services</li>
  <li>supplied free of charge</li>
  <li>on long-term hire, loan or lease</li>
  <li>to be installed or used in construction</li>
  <li>lost or destroyed - if goods dispatched from the UK are lost or destroyed in transit they should be recorded on the <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> (this does not apply to arrivals)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are certain circumstances where movements of goods are excluded:</p>

<ul>
<li>goods not by way of trade (for example personal goods such as travel luggage, items involved in moving house or ballast)</li>
  <li>goods in transit including goods which are in transit through the UK</li>
  <li>certain purely temporary movements where the goods are to be returned to the original <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country within two years and there is to be no change of ownership</li>
  <li>monetary gold</li>
  <li>means of payment which are legal tender and securities, including means which are payments for services such as postage, taxes, user fees</li>
  <li>goods moving between the UK and its territorial enclaves (for example embassies, armed forces bases) in another Member State or moving within the UK to an enclave of another Member State</li>
  <li>goods used as carriers of customised information, including software</li>
  <li>software downloaded from the internet</li>
  <li>commercial samples and advertising material provided free of charge</li>
  <li>goods sent for or returned after repair</li>
  <li>means of transport travelling in the course of their work, including spacecraft launchers at the time of launching</li>
  <li>newspapers and periodicals supplied under direct subscription</li>
</ul>
<p>All <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses must enter the total value of any arrivals or dispatches, from or to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states in boxes 8 and 9 of their normal <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/returns-accounts/completing-returns.htm">how to complete your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return box by box</a>.</p>

<p>If you are <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered and supply goods and certain types of services to a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered customer in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you will also need to submit their details, the country code and the value of the transaction in an EC Sales List (ESL). <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will send an ESL to any business completing box 8. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/esl/reporting-esl.htm">reporting your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> sales using the EC Sales List (ESL)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="who-does-intrastat-serve">Who does Intrastat serve?</h3>

<p>Information about the trade between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states is crucial to governments and organisations, as well as to businesses.</p>

<p>Trade statistics enable governments, including the UK, to monitor the health of their economies and the balance of payments. Trade figures also affect other decisions that have an impact on the daily life - eg the Bank of England’s decisions regarding interest rates.</p>

<p>A number of UK government departments use these trade statistics to spot trends, set trade policy and find ways to help UK businesses. Outside the UK, Intrastat data is included in the trade information supplied to the European Commission, the European Central Bank and United Nations bodies such as the International Monetary Fund.<br>
Your business can also benefit by using trade data to assess market share, look for gaps in the market and develop new markets.</p>

<h2 id="intrastat-sds-delivery-methods-and-deadlines">Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>: delivery methods and deadlines</h2>

<p>There are two ways you can submit your monthly Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
<li>via the internet</li>
  <li>through the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)/EDIFACT</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="internet-returns">Internet returns</h3>

<p>You can complete your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> and file them online on the uktradeinfo website. You can use either an online form or use a Comma Separated Variable (CSV) file compiled offline. You’ll need to register and obtain a username and password to use this service. For more information, see the guide on Intrastat: technology and technicalities.</p>

<h3 id="edi-returns">EDI returns</h3>

<p>You can also use the EDI system to file your returns via email. You’ll need to supply the file in a specific format to do so. Find out about making Intrastat submissions using EDI/EDIFACT in the guide on Intrastat: technology and technicalities.</p>

<h3 id="the-period-covered-and-monthly-cut-off-date">The period covered and monthly cut-off date</h3>

<p>You must submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> on a monthly basis - eg you must submit declarations for the January period so that they are received by the 21st day of the month following the period for which you are reporting transactions - April <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> must be submitted by 21st of May. A calendar month is the normal reference period and you must use four digits to show the month and year for which you are reporting transactions - (mmyy) - eg 0411 for April 2011.</p>

<p>If your business is approved to use non-standard <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> periods, the reference period can be either the calendar month in which the goods arrive in - or are dispatched from - the UK, or the calendar month of the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> tax point.</p>

<p>You can choose the method that will best enable your business to meet its Intrastat duties. Note however, that if your business has 13 x 4 - week <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> periods, you must ensure that one of your Intrastat periods includes one eight-week period to allow 12 submission periods in total.</p>

<p>If you exceed the threshold on both arrivals and dispatches, you must separately provide information on your inbound and outbound trade and submit both forms.</p>

<p>The data you provide on <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> forms for Intrastat purposes is also used for purposes of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> regulations.</p>

<p>You can submit as many <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> as you like each month. Submitting nil returns will prevent you from being contacted for missing declarations and timely, complete and accurate submissions will avoid costly penalty action.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to monitor your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade to determine when you must submit an <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will also be monitoring the value of your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade and may write to you from time to time to check that your records and theirs tally. If you have received a letter relating to <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> submission and are unsure as to how to proceed, you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Intrastat/ReceiptOfLetter/Pages/letteronetwenty.aspx">find clarification on Intrastat letters on the uktradeinfo website</a>.</p>

<p>Find the technical specifications in the guide on Intrastat: technology and technicalities.</p>

<h2 id="intrastat-sds-required-information">Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>: required information</h2>

<p>To complete Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>, you will need specific information to hand. The key fields are introduced below. You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Intrastat/StepByStep/Pages/introduction.aspx">read the Intrastat six-step guide on the uktradeinfo website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="business-information">Business information</h3>

<p>You will need your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registration number and branch identifier if required. If an agent is submitting <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> on your behalf, they’ll also need to supply their own matching information. You will also need your sales or purchase ledgers, invoices, and any other commercial documentation relating to the sale or purchase of goods for the month of return.</p>

<h3 id="period-covered">Period covered</h3>

<p>You must submit Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> on a monthly basis - eg you must submit declarations for the January period so that they are received by the 21st of February. A calendar month is the normal reference period and you must use four digits to show the month and year for which you are reporting transactions - (mmyy) - eg 0411 for April 2011.</p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>

<p>If your transactions are in currencies other than sterling, you will need to use official exchange rates to convert the value of the good. You should list the value in pounds sterling rounded up to the nearest pound in the same way as your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return. You must not include duty or service charges that may have been included on the invoice. <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/TradeTools/Pages/ExchangeRates.aspx">Find exchange rates on the uktradeinfo website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="commodity-code">Commodity code</h3>

<p>You must correctly classify your goods using the Intrastat Classification Nomenclature (<abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr>) codes. Accurate classification of goods is the key to reliable statistics so the commodity code under which you list your goods on the <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> is arguably the most important data field on the form.</p>

<p>Commodity codes for all goods are described in the Combined Nomenclature (<abbr title="Combined Nomenclature">CN</abbr>) on which the Integrated Tariff of the UK is based. A simplified <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> is produced for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade, omitting duty and tariff details. You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/TradeTools/ICN/Pages/ICNSearch.aspx">search for correct commodity codes in the online <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> on the uktradeinfo website</a>.</p>

<p>If you need advice on a particular code, you can contact the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Tariff Classification Service Enquiry Line on Tel 01702 366 077.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/TradeTools/ICN/Pages/ICNInfoAndHelp.aspx">find out about the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> classification system on the uktradeinfo website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="nature-of-transaction-codes">Nature of Transaction Codes</h3>

<p>Special codes are used to signify what type of transaction you’re reporting. See the section in this guide on <a href="#How-to-deal-with-complex-transactions" title="How to deal with complex transactions">how to deal with complex transactions</a>. </p>

<h3 id="weight-or-supplementary-units">Weight or supplementary units</h3>

<p>You must record the weight (net mass in kilograms) or a supplementary unit for each data line of goods. The required unit of measurement is defined by the commodity code. Only one measure is required.</p>

<h3 id="country-codes">Country codes</h3>

<p>On <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for ‘arrivals’, you must use the country code indicating the member state from where the goods have come. On the <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> for ‘dispatches’, you must use the code for the member state to which you have sent the goods. For the list, see the section on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-complete-your-intrastat-supplementary-declaration#intrastat-supplementary-declaration-country-codes" title="Intrastat SD country codes">Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> country codes</a> in our guide on completing your Intrastat SD.</p>

<h3 id="delivery-terms">Delivery terms</h3>

<p>If the value of the goods you acquire or supply exceeds £16 million annually, you will also have to record the delivery terms on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you exceed the Intrastat threshold on intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade in any calendar year - either for arrivals or dispatches, or both - you must start submitting arrivals and/or dispatches on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>On your form, list the arrivals or dispatches that were actually carried out during the relevant period. To reduce paperwork, you are encouraged to combine values and quantities of goods where all other details are identical.</p>

<p>Commercial software is available to automate the process of Intrastat returns. See information on submitting Intrastat returns electronically in the guide on Intrastat: technology and technicalities.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-deal-with-complex-transactions">How to deal with complex transactions</h2>

<p>While the reporting requirements for Intrastat are simple, there are occasions where the nature of your business may mean your responsibilities are more complex - such as when your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting periods don’t align with calendar months or goods have been returned. Most of these issues can be resolved simply.</p>

<h3 id="location-of-goods">Location of goods</h3>

<p>It’s essential to remember that the movement of your goods is the most important element in completing your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> correctly. For example, if you buy goods from a customer in Spain but the goods are dispatched from Germany, you should record those arrivals as coming from Germany, rather than Spain. This is known as triangulation.</p>

<h3 id="errors-credit-notes-and-retrospective-discounts">Errors, credit notes and retrospective discounts</h3>

<p>Sometimes you will have to issue credit notes or discounts after your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> for the period has been submitted. When this happens, you need to add a balancing entry to your next return covering the credit. To do so using the electronic service, you must use the first digit of the Nature of Transaction Code (<abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr>) followed by a ‘6’. This will indicate to the system that it’s a minus value and will balance your records accordingly.</p>

<p>A similar principle is followed if an adjustment needs to be made as a result of a change in trading terms or goods being returned, such as goods shipped and not paid for or the receipt of stage payments. Further information on this can be found in section 7.2 of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Notice 60. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>However, you must not use NoTCs to amend errors on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>. If you find an error, you must supply an additional declaration for that period.</p>

<h3 id="customs-processes">Customs processes</h3>

<p>If your goods are entered into customs processes, this will have an impact on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> reporting.</p>

<p>If your goods move into customs warehouses or Free Zones, you do not record them for Intrastat. If the goods are brought into free circulation and then move to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state, an Intrastat report will be required. This also applies to goods moved between excise warehouses in different member states. Goods moving between excise warehouses within the UK should not be reported for Intrastat.</p>

<p>For goods going into an excise warehouse in the UK from another member state there are different rules depending on whether the goods are for retail distribution or are to be further processed.</p>

<p>If your goods are covered by Inward Processing (<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>) suspension and are moving under Community Transit procedures, you do not include them on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>. If both you and the company in the other member state are approved by their respective customs authorities to use the simplified procedure for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension goods, the movements should be reported on the <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can find further information about the arrangements for goods in customs processes in sections 17.1 to 17.4 of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Notice 60. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-detailed-information">Other detailed information</h3>

<p>The uktradeinfo website has detailed information for other special situations, such as the position for leasing and hire of goods, progress and stage payments and goods on sale or return.</p>

<h2 id="intrastat-sds-record-keeping">Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>: record keeping</h2>

<p>In addition to the legal requirement to submit accurate <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> within the prescribed deadlines, you must keep specific paperwork when completing and filing <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="key-documents">Key documents</h3>

<p>You must retain a copy of every <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> you submit - or an agent submits on your behalf - and all papers and documents used to compile your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for at least six years.<br>
You can keep these documents in an electronic format, provided it can be read by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="inspections">Inspections</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> carries out inspections from time to time to ensure that businesses are complying with their Intrastat obligations. The visit is almost always to your premises, even if you use an agent. When the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> representative visits, they’ll need access to all your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>-related paperwork, so it’s advisable to keep your records organised.</p>

<h3 id="day-to-day-management">Day-to-day management</h3>

<p>In most cases, managing your Intrastat responsibilities will be comparatively simple. It’s prudent to check your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> against your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return to see if the figures tally.</p>

<p>Any differences between your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns and <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> may be queried by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, although <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> understands that circumstances - such as credit notes - may create a discrepancy between the <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> and the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return.</p>

<p>Check Notice 60, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s guide to Intrastat - for more detailed guidance on inspections and day-to-day management of your Intrastat responsibilities. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="penalties-for-late-or-inaccurate-intrastat-sds">Penalties for late or inaccurate Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you fail to submit your Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> by their due date, or send <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> data that is incomplete or inaccurate, you may be committing a criminal offence.</p>

<p>The penalties involved are seen as a last resort, but they may be imposed where <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> are persistently late, missing, inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

<p>Although the Penalty regime is a criminal one and could result in proceedings in a Magistrates Court, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> would normally prefer to ‘compound’ alleged offences. This involves the offer of an administrative fine in lieu of court proceedings. However, an administrative fine is only offered when, after receiving a Warning of Possible Criminal Proceedings letter, a business has brought its Intrastat declarations completely up to date. If any declarations remain outstanding, court proceedings will be instigated.</p>

<p>You should pay any administrative fines electronically by Bacs Direct Credit, Internet/Telephone banking or CHAPS, using the following bank account details:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Sort Code</th>
      <th>Account Number</th>
      <th>Account Name</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>08 32 00</td>
      <td>12000903</td>
      <td>Indirect Miscellaneous Account</td>
    </tr></tbody>
</table>
<p>When making your payment please ensure you quote your reference number - <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> followed by your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Registration Number, eg IP123456789.</p>

<p>Administrative penalties and court fines are a totally unnecessary financial burden on business which can be avoided by compliance with the Intrastat system. So, please, ensure that your data is complete, and accurate, and is sent to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in plenty of time. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can provide help on the completion of the Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for businesses experiencing difficulties.</p>
