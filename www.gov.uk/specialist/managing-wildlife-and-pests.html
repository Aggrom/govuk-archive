<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Wildlife can cause significant damage to farmers’ livestock and feedstuffs if effective prevention and control measures are not in place. Some species can also increase the risk of disease among livestock, pets and humans.</p>

<p>The Natural England Wildlife Management and Licensing Service (<abbr title="Wildlife Management and Licensing Service">WMLS</abbr>) provides advice on managing wildlife problems and issues wildlife licences in England. Many pest control activities may not need a licence, but if you are unsure, you should check with Natural England.</p>

<h2 id="mammal-pest-control">Mammal pest control</h2>

<p>Farmers and land managers can legally control some mammal species for particular problems, such as damage to crops or risks to health and safety.</p>

<p>You will need a licence from Natural England to manage some mammal species or to use certain control measures - see the page in this guide on licences for pest control.</p>

<p>You do not need a licence for certain control measures involving rats and house mice. For more information, see the page in this guide on rat and mice control.</p>

<h3 id="mammal-control">Mammal control</h3>

<p>You can get advice from Natural England about minimising damage to land or crops caused by mammal species, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>foxes</li>
  <li>rabbits</li>
  <li>moles</li>
  <li>badgers</li>
  <li>edible dormice</li>
  <li>non-native mammals</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/species/default.aspx">find information about different mammal species on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/advice/advisoryleaflets.aspx">find advice on controlling and reducing damage from specific mammal species on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<h3 id="foxes">Foxes</h3>

<p>Rural foxes eat a wide range of food items and will sometimes kill large numbers of easy prey animals - such as captive hens. They are less significant as carriers of disease.</p>

<p>Foxes can pose a risk to:</p>

<ul>
<li>poultry</li>
  <li>lambs</li>
  <li>outdoor-reared piglets</li>
  <li>game</li>
</ul>
<p>Measures to protect livestock may in the long run prove more cost-effective than culling. If you do plan to cull a fox population, you should avoid the fox dispersal period of October to March - as this makes it likely that the culled animals will be quickly replaced.</p>

<p>Other control methods for deterring foxes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>permanent fences</li>
  <li>electric fences</li>
  <li>using llamas to guard stock</li>
  <li>flashing lights</li>
  <li>shooting</li>
  <li>snares - see the page in this guide on pest control: snares</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rabbits">Rabbits</h3>

<p>Rabbits are estimated to cause damage to rural areas of about £100 million each year. Farmers and landowners have a responsibility to control wild rabbits on their land or take steps to prevent them causing damage. This is a continuing obligation.</p>

<p>As with other species, co-operation with your neighbours is vital. Where rabbits live on railway land, you should call the Network Rail helpline on 08457 11 41 41.</p>

<p>See the page on managing rabbits, hares and grey squirrels in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/wild-mammals-management-and-control-options">wild mammals.</a></p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/species/rabbits.aspx">find information on rabbits on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<h3 id="moles">Moles</h3>

<p>Mole management is best carried out between October and April, but you should be aware that moles are protected by legislation preventing cruelty to wild mammals.</p>

<p>There are two main approved control methods for moles:</p>

<ul>
<li>poisoning with aluminium phosphide</li>
  <li>spring traps</li>
</ul>
<p>See the page on managing mice, rats, moles and edible dormice in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/wild-mammals-management-and-control-options">wild mammals.</a></p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/species/moles.aspx">find information about moles on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<h3 id="badgers">Badgers</h3>

<p>The UK has some of the highest densities of badgers in Europe - over 30 per square kilometre in some areas. Problems caused by badgers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>crop damage</li>
  <li>land damage</li>
  <li>poultry predation</li>
  <li>spread of disease</li>
  <li>undermining drainage works or flood defences</li>
</ul>
<p>In July 2010, the Badger Vaccine Deployment Project programme (<abbr title="Badger Vaccine Deployment Project">BVDP</abbr>) began in the Gloucestershire area to develop the techniques to vaccinate wild badgers and reduce the risk of their spreading bovine tuberculosis to cattle. Find more information in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/cattle-health">cattle health.</a> You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/wildlife/ecologyManagement/bvdp">find information on BDVP on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<p>You can apply to Natural England for a licence to close down a problematic badger sett or, in exceptional circumstances, to kill badgers. Preventative measures include:</p>

<ul>
<li>fencing</li>
  <li>badger-proofing buildings</li>
  <li>limiting contact with cattle</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/species/badgers.aspx">Find information on controlling and managing badgers on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<h3 id="edible-fat-dormouse">Edible (fat) dormouse</h3>

<p>Edible dormice, or fat dormice, can cause damage in a number of ways, including stripping tree bark and damaging electrical cables within buildings. No licence is needed for non-prohibited control measures, such as shooting.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/species/edibledormice.aspx">Find information on controlling and managing edible dormice on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<p>You can also find out more on the page on managing mice, rats, moles and edible dormice in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/wild-mammals-management-and-control-options">wild mammals.</a></p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance-and-environmental-stewardship">Cross compliance and Environmental Stewardship</h3>

<p>It is possible to get funding for measures to protect and enhance wild mammal habitats through the Environmental Stewardship schemes run by Natural England. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-stewardship">Environmental Stewardship: the basics.</a></p>

<p>You must comply with cross compliance requirements in order to qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme and other direct payments - such as the Environmental Stewardship scheme. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental conditions">GAECs</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 5 is the cross compliance requirement to maintain habitats and species by protecting flora and fauna. <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/4842372e89122fef802573aa00550ea7/%24FILE/SMR%205%202012%20v1.0.pdf">Download <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 5 (habitats and species) from the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website.

<h2 id="bird-pest-control">Bird pest control</h2>

<p>All wild birds and their nests and eggs are officially protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The government does permit hunting for some quarry birds during defined seasons, as well as shooting or trapping to control named species under general licence under certain specific circumstances and subject to meeting the general licence’s eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/licences/generallicences.aspx">find information on general licence and bird pest control on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<p>You can find wild bird management advice in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/wild-birds">wild birds.</a></p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance-and-environmental-stewardship-1">Cross compliance and Environmental Stewardship</h3>

<p>You can get information on conservation measures to encourage wild birds through the Environmental Stewardship schemes run by Natural England. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-stewardship">Environmental Stewardship: the basics.</a></p>

<p>You must comply with cross compliance requirements to qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme and other direct payments, such as the Environmental Stewardship scheme. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<h2 id="licences-for-pest-control">Licences for pest control</h2>

<p>The Natural England <abbr title="Wildlife Management and Licensing Service">WMLS</abbr> is responsible for wildlife licensing activities in England.</p>

<p>Some management activities can be carried out under a general licence. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/licences/generallicences.aspx">find information on general licences on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<p>You may need to apply for a specific licence to manage some species or to use certain control methods. For common pest species, such as rats and house mice, you may not need a licence at all. Some control methods are illegal, irrespective of the species concerned, so you should always seek legal advice if you are unsure.</p>

<h3 id="general-licences">General licences</h3>

<p>A general licence allows you to carry out certain pest control actions to prevent damage or disease that would normally be illegal without a specific licence.</p>

<p>You can get a general licence to control certain species that:</p>

<ul>
<li>compromise air safety</li>
  <li>cause crop damage</li>
  <li>threaten the conservation of other species</li>
</ul>
<p>You should carefully check the terms of the general licences, as each is very specific as to the species and circumstances covered.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/licences/generallicences.aspx">find information on general licences on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<h3 id="specific-licences">Specific licences</h3>

<p>Many circumstances will not be covered by a general licence and you may need to apply for a specific licence.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/licences/applicationforms.aspx">find specific licence application forms on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<h3 id="bird-species-control">Bird species control</h3>

<p>You can apply for specific licences to control bird species to prevent agricultural damage.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/licences/applicationforms.aspx">find specific licence application forms on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<p>You are responsible for controlling any rats or house mice that are on your agricultural land. You do not have to notify your local authority.</p>

<p>Rats consume, on average, 25-30 grams of food per day and contaminate their surroundings with droppings, urine and hairs. They also cause structural damage to buildings by gnawing and burrowing.</p>

<p>Diseases and parasites carried by rats that are potentially harmful to humans and animals include:</p>

<ul>
<li>leptospirosis (Weil’s disease)</li>
  <li>toxoplasmosis</li>
  <li>salmonella</li>
</ul>
<p>Contamination of food premises by rats and mice could lead to prosecution under food safety laws. The presence of rats can also threaten assurance scheme accreditation.</p>

<h3 id="control-methods-for-rats-and-mice">Control methods for rats and mice</h3>

<p>You can use several methods to control rats and mice. You should always consider preventative measures first, such as proofing, removal of potential food sources and removal of harborage. If necessary control methods can then be carried out alongside preventative measures.</p>

<p>For best results, it is usually best to use a combination. Always ensure that the products you use are legal for the species of rodent and situation involved. You must always follow the statutory instructions on the pesticide label to ensure a safe, effective and lawful treatment. Remember that these products are toxic to humans and pets as well as rats and mice and proper safety precautions must be taken to minimise risks.</p>

<p>If you don’t control rats and mice on your land, your local authority can step in to do the work and recover the costs from you.</p>

<p>Control methods could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>trapping</li>
  <li>shooting</li>
  <li>chemical control using fumigants or rodenticide baits</li>
</ul>
<p>When planning a control programme, you should take into account:</p>

<ul>
<li>the scale of infestation</li>
  <li>available resources</li>
  <li>your experience</li>
  <li>risks to non-target wildlife, pets, livestock and humans</li>
</ul>
<p>Break-back spring traps can be useful for controlling house mice and rats - especially when only small numbers are present.</p>

<h3 id="mice-control-rodenticides">Mice control: rodenticides</h3>

<p>Rodenticides can be used to control rats and house mice. As with any pesticide it is important to read the label and follow the instructions so that treatments are undertaken safely and effectively. Users must be competent and adequately instructed in all aspects of rodenticide use.</p>

<p>To poison mice, you should use second-generation anti-coagulant compounds - such as bromadiolone or difenacoum. First-generation anti-coagulants, eg warfarin and chlorophacinone, are not suitable as many populations are now resistant.</p>

<p>If consistent with the product instructions, you should place small amounts of bait in many different locations that show signs of use, as mice prefer to feed in this way. Bait points must be protected from non-target species.</p>

<h3 id="rat-control-rodenticides">Rat control: rodenticides</h3>

<p>As with any pesticide it is important to read the label and follow the instructions so that treatments are undertaken safely and effectively. Users must be competent and adequately instructed in all aspects of rodenticide use. Poisoning options for rats start with first-generation anti-coagulant rodenticides such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>warfarin</li>
  <li>coumatetralyl</li>
  <li>chlorophacinone</li>
</ul>
<p>Where resistance is present among rat populations, you can also use more toxic, second-generation rodenticides, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>difenacoum</li>
  <li>bromadiolone</li>
  <li>flocoumafen (must not be used outdoors)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should place the bait at suitable points throughout the entire area where rat activity has been noticed. Bait points must be protected from non-target species.</p>

<h2 id="pest-control-snares">Pest control: snares</h2>

<p>Snares are a common capture and control method, often used for foxes and rabbits.</p>

<p>Capture and control methods raise welfare concerns and pose a potential risk to non-target species. You should research whether you need to use snares. Preventative measures can sometimes be a better option.</p>

<p>If you do set snares for animal control, your methods must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be legal</li>
  <li>be humane</li>
  <li>avoid non-target species</li>
  <li>be carried out with sensitivity and respect for other countryside users</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-species-for-snaring">Target species for snaring</h3>

<p>The most common target species for snaring are:</p>

<ul>
<li>foxes</li>
  <li>rabbits</li>
  <li>grey squirrels</li>
  <li>mink</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="snare-design">Snare design</h3>

<p>You should use a free-running snare for trapping animals. This is a wire loop that relaxes when the animal stops pulling.</p>

<h3 id="snares-how-to-operate">Snares: how to operate</h3>

<p>Snares are designed to be used to capture, not kill, animals. You should have considerable experience of placing snares and animal tracks/signs to ensure only target species are likely to be caught. You should always place them where surrounding objects, buildings or vegetation will not cause the animal unnecessary injury after it has been caught.</p>

<p>To improve the effectiveness of snares, you can remove the manufacturers’ lubricant by boiling them before use. You can also coat the wire with paraffin wax to reduce the human scent.</p>

<h3 id="snares-code-of-practice">Snares: code of practice</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> has introduced a code of good practice for snaring.</p>
