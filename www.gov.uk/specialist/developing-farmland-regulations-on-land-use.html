<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As UK farmers look to modernise, develop and grow their businesses, many are generating profitable alternative uses for land and buildings, as well as creating new jobs and services in the countryside that benefit local communities.</p>

<p>While the government tries to minimise the loss of farmland, it is also taking a positive approach to creating a more diverse rural economy.</p>

<p>This guide will explain what is involved in applying for changes to the use of land and buildings, and what farmers and land managers need to consider in planning and land use. You can find out how to apply for planning permission, what local planning authorities will take into account and where to get further advice, guidance and information.</p>

<h2 id="planning-permission">Planning permission</h2>

<p>If you wish to change the way in which you use land and/or carry out development work, it is likely that you will have to apply to your local authority or the National Park planning authority for permission to do. They will assess your plan to make sure it is in keeping with local development plans, existing infrastructure, permitted dimensions and materials as appropriate to the area.</p>

<h3 id="when-do-i-need-planning-permission">When do I need planning permission?</h3>

<p>If you are proposing to change the use of land or buildings from agricultural use, you will need planning permission. It is also always required for dwellings. It is often a prerequisite of obtaining grant funding for a project.</p>

<h3 id="when-do-i-not-need-planning-permission">When do I not need planning permission?</h3>

<p>Planning permission is not required for:</p>

<ul>
<li>agricultural operations</li>
  <li>using existing buildings on agricultural land for agricultural purposes</li>
  <li>changes to the inside of buildings, or small alterations to the outside - eg installing an alarm box</li>
  <li>changes when permitted development rights exist</li>
</ul>
<p>Always check with your local planning authority before starting work, otherwise you risk having to cease the new activities or demolish the new buildings.</p>

<h2 id="agricultural-land-classification-and-soil-types">Agricultural Land Classification and soil types</h2>

<p>Land quality varies from place to place. The Agricultural Land Classification (<abbr title="Agricultural Land Classification">ALC</abbr>) provides a method for assessing the quality of farmland to enable informed choices to be made about its future use within the planning system. It helps underpin the principles of sustainable development.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Agricultural Land Classification">ALC</abbr> system classifies land into five grades, with Grade 3 subdivided into Subgrades 3a and 3b.</p>

<p>The best and most versatile land is defined as Grades 1, 2 and 3a by policy guidance. This is the land which is most flexible, productive and efficient in response to inputs and which can best deliver future crops for food and non-food uses such as biomass, fibres and pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>Current estimates are that Grades 1 and 2 together form about 21 per cent of all farmland in England - Subgrade 3a contains a similar amount.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/35012?category=23033">See the publication Agricultural Land Classification: protecting the best and most versatile agricultural land, on the Natural England website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="soil-types">Soil types</h3>

<p>Soil types are a major component of the <abbr title="Agricultural Land Classification">ALC</abbr> system. England’s soils are diverse, reflecting the wide range of underlying rock types and drainage, and are variable in their characteristics. Soil types can change over short distances because of complex interactions between underlying geology, landform, past and existing land use and climate.</p>

<p>Soil in England is classified into 10 major groups, with nearly 700 soil types grouped into around 300 associations that typically reflect the varied geology of the parent rock.</p>

<p>These have been further simplified into 27 classifications of what are known as ‘soilscapes’, which group soils according to similar basic properties and link this to information on habitats, fertility and land use.</p>

<h2 id="permitted-development">Permitted development</h2>

<p>The Town &amp; Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 provides general planning permission known as ‘permitted development rights’ for certain types of minor development.</p>

<p>The types of permitted development most likely to benefit farmers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>temporary uses of land</li>
  <li>agricultural buildings below a certain size</li>
  <li>forestry buildings</li>
  <li>caravan sites and related buildings in some circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>There are permitted development rights for erecting (on holdings of five hectares or more), extending or altering a building, and for excavations and engineering operations that are reasonably necessary for agricultural purposes - though you may still require approval for certain details of the development.</p>

<p>For most other types of development and change of use, you will generally need to apply for planning permission.</p>

<p>For more information, <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264083&amp;id=264299">download Communities and Local Government  information on permitted development rights for agriculture and forestry from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 46K)</a>.</p>

<p>Permitted development rights are not available for:</p>

<ul>
<li>farm or forestry dwellings</li>
  <li>livestock units sited near residential and similar buildings</li>
</ul>
<p>Before making use of agricultural permitted development rights, it is always best to check with the local planning authority.</p>

<p>There are additional controls for permitted development that may affect legally protected wildlife sites.</p>

<p>For Special Areas of Conservation (<abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SACs</abbr>), candidate <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SACs</abbr> and Special Protection Areas (<abbr title="Special Protection Areas">SPAs</abbr>) the local authority must establish - in consultation with Natural England - that such development would not affect the integrity of the site. This includes development outside the site boundaries that could affect how it functions.</p>

<p>Farmers can either apply to the local authority for written permission, or apply to Natural England for a formal decision as to whether the permitted development would have a significant effect on a site.</p>

<p>If Natural England decide that the development would not have an adverse effect on the site, then no prior approval is required, provided the development meets all other permitted development conditions and restrictions. If Natural England decides that the development would affect a site, then the farmer can apply in writing to a local authority as with the previous option.</p>

<p>If you are a landowner or occupier wants to carry out works on a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>), and those works are listed on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> notification as operations likely to damage the special interest features of the land, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply to Natural England for a consent - if this is refused then it would be an offence to go ahead with the work. You have a right of appeal.</li>
  <li>Apply to the local authority for planning permission - if permission is granted then the works can be carried out.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compulsory-purchase-of-land-for-development">Compulsory purchase of land for development</h3>

<p>‘Compulsory purchase’ or compulsory acquisition refers to the government’s ability to buy private rights in land in order to benefit society.</p>

<p>The law regarding compulsory purchase of land for development is laid out in Part 8 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.</p>

<h3 id="planning-permission-and-protected-species">Planning permission and protected species</h3>

<p>Legally protected species can be affected by development or change of use - for example, bats may roost in barns or outhouses. If a local authority thinks that protected species are likely to be affected by a development, then this will be taken into account when granting planning permission. They may ask you, as the applicant, to supply survey information to help them with their decision. In some cases, a licence from Natural England may also be required. Surveys should always be carried out by appropriately qualified and licensed individuals.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/wildlife/default.aspx">Find information on protected species on the Natural England website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-impact-assessment-and-cross-compliance">Environmental Impact Assessment and cross compliance</h2>

<p>Environmental Impact Assessment (<abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr>) is a formal procedure where a local planning authority or Natural England (in relation to uncultivated, semi-natural or restructuring of rural land project) assesse the potential environmental impact of certain new developments and changes to land use before they are allowed to proceed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> in England and Wales is covered by the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2011. There are separate arrangements in Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland. Changes to uncultivated or semi-improved land or a project to restructure rural land are covered by the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (England)(No 2) Regulations 2006 and forestry related projects are covered by the Environmental Impact Assessment (Forestry) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999.</p>

<h3 id="when-is-eia-required">When is <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> required?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> is mandatory for certain developments, such as large installations for the intensive rearing of poultry and pigs. It may also be required for developments in sensitive locations such as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>

<p>Improvement of uncultivated or semi-natural land, by for example ploughing or fertiliser application, may also be covered by <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr>. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-impact-assessments">Environmental Impact Assessments (<abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>Your local planning authority is responsible for administering the <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> regulations in relation to development and can advise whether an <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> is required. Natural England is the regulator for changes to uncultivated or semi-improved land and restructuring of rural land projects.</p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance">Cross compliance</h3>

<p>Farmers must comply with certain legal conditions when planning and using their land. These conditions are known as cross compliance and consist of 19 existing European laws known as Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>). Cross compliance also involves maintaining land in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>).</p>

<p>For more information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> and <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>, see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/cross-compliance-the-basics">cross compliance: the basics</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/statutory-management-requirements">Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr>)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/standards-of-good-agricultural-and-environmental-condition">standards of good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="registering-your-land-on-the-rural-land-register">Registering your land on the Rural Land Register</h2>

<p>The Rural Payment Agency’s (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s) Rural Land Register (RLR) holds accurate, up-to-date digital maps of all farmed land. It should be noted that the RLR is not the same as the HM Land Registry. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/registering-your-land">registering your land</a>.</p>

<p>You must register your land on the RLR for:</p>

<h3 id="edwards-top-tips">Edward’s top tips:</h3>

<ul>
<li>“Basically it means that every time we go into a field we are going down the same wheeling.”</li>
  <li>“We’ve reduced the amount of the time we are in the field now, and there’s more land for direct drilling.”</li>
  <li>“Diesel usage has gone from 120 litres a hectare down to around 60 litres a hectare.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Edward Dale is an arable and combinable crop farmer from Lincolnshire. Here he outlines the benefits of controlled traffic farming: water soaks through the ground better, increased yields, less fuel usage, less time establishing a crop and more fertile soil.<br>
