<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Following the correct procedures for goods that require permission before you import or export will help you avoid transport and processing delays and may improve your finances. You can also take advantage of trading schemes known as ‘preferences’ and ‘tariff quotas’ which aim to boost trade in certain products and with particular countries by reducing duties. You may need a licence if you want to take part in these schemes.</p>

<p>International trade is heavily regulated for some goods and you should be aware that you may suffer significant penalties if you don’t have the necessary documentation and your goods might be seized by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). Unlawful trade in some goods, such as weapons to countries under sanction, can result in criminal action.</p>

<p>For detailed information on licences and sanctions related to controlled goods, refer to the guide on controlled goods: licences, sanctions and embargoes.</p>

<h2 id="check-if-you-need-a-permit-or-certificate">Check if you need a permit or certificate</h2>

<p>Will you need extra paperwork for your goods, over and above the usual commercial and licensing documentation? Requirements for a permit or certificate will depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of product</li>
  <li>your product’s commodity code</li>
  <li>where your product originated from</li>
  <li>whether you’re exporting or importing</li>
  <li>your product’s final destination</li>
</ul>
<p>Your trade association may be able to advise on export controls applying to your products.</p>

<h3 id="using-classification-to-find-licences">Using classification to find licences</h3>

<p>When you import, identify the commodity code for your goods to find out if you need a licence. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing our free online UK Trade Tariff.</a></p>
</div>

<p>You can also use the Tariff to check if you need a permit. You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check your product’s code in the Tariff, and look up the rules associated with it.</li>
  <li>Check the rules regarding the origin of your products. See the guide on the rules of origin.</li>
  <li>Check the rules that vary according to whether you are importing or exporting the product, and its final destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also check with the relevant government department. </p>

<h3 id="declarations-and-licences">Declarations and licences</h3>

<p>Using a Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>), most exports to outside the EU must be declared to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> through the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system. You can do this electronically using the National Export System (NES). See the guide on the UK’s import and export processing system CHIEF.</p>

<p>You can use the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>, also known as form C88, to make export declarations manually. Customs will then enter these goods to the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system on your behalf. Manual entry will delay the movement of your goods from the UK.</p>

<p>However, the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> is an export declaration, not a licence to export goods. If your goods need a licence you must obtain one separately before the goods are due to leave the UK or EU.</p>

<p>Goods that are of no statistical interest or not restricted can be exported without a declaration. Included in this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>accompanied personal or household goods</li>
  <li>certain goods not subject to a commercial transaction</li>
  <li>certain temporary exportation or re-exportation goods</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read about the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> in the guide on declarations and the Single Administrative Document.</p>

<p>You do not usually have to complete an export declaration for goods acquired or dispatched within the EU. There are exceptions, such as sales to international organisations which are treated as exports, and exports to special EU territories.</p>

<h2 id="major-import-licences-permits-and-certificates">Major import licences, permits and certificates</h2>

<p>You need a licence if you are importing or exporting certain Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) commodities from or to a country not in the EU. Licences help to monitor and control these markets. These are issued by the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) - you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/4CCBA8C61D82148080256F72003D614C?Opendocument">read guidance on <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> licences on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>The Import Licensing Branch (ILB) of the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) issues the licences required when you import:</p>

<ul>
<li>certain textiles</li>
  <li>firearms and ammunition</li>
  <li>nuclear materials</li>
  <li>iron and steel from some countries</li>
</ul>
<p>There are prohibitions on the import of anti-personnel mines, torture equipment and certain goods from specified countries. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/trade-policy-unit/importing-into-uk/import-licensing-branch">Read about current requirements for ILB licences on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) issues licences required when you import:</p>

<ul>
<li>meat, poultry, milk and other foodstuffs</li>
  <li>livestock</li>
  <li>blood</li>
  <li>plant/plant products</li>
  <li>endangered species</li>
  <li>fur</li>
</ul>
<p>Some food products, such as types of food colouring or products affected by avian flu, are banned.</p>

<p>Plant-health controlled fruit, vegetables, plants and plant products need a Quarantine Release Certificate (QRC) and/or import licence. Importers must also check if a product requires a Plant Health Movement Document. <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/imports/index.cfm">Download the Plant Health Guide for Importers from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 108KB).</a></p>

<p>If you trade in products made from endangered plant and animal species, these must be accompanied by a <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) licence. Species affected are listed in three appendices to the Convention, according to the degree of protection they need.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalhealth/CITES/index.htm">Find out about <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> permit information for import, export or commercial use of endangered species on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a> You should also be aware that goods imported under <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> licence regimes may also require licences by a competent authority from the country of export.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> also administers controls on trade in ozone-depleting substances (<abbr title="Ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr>) and products and equipment containing those substances, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>refrigeration and air-conditioning products</li>
  <li>fire-fighting and foam-blowing equipment</li>
  <li>aerosols and solvents</li>
</ul>
<p>To import <abbr title="Ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr>, you must have a quota licence from the European Commission under Commission Notice 2009/C132/12. You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ozone/ods_en.htm">request a licence from the European Commission’s <abbr title="Ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr>-database on the Europa website.</a></p>

<p>Certain substances that potentially cause cancer, known as carcinogenic substances, or chemicals and animal hair, are prohibited from import unless you have a Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) Exemption Certificate. For details of exemptions, email the <abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> at <a href="mailto:UKDNA@hse.gsi.gov.uk">UKDNA@hse.gsi.gov.uk</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pic/about.htm">read about dangerous chemical licensing on the <abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a> Import of cat and dog fur is banned in the UK.</p>

<p>Under Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>) legislation, importers or manufacturers of more than one tonne of chemicals a year must register with the European Chemicals Agency and declare any dangerous substances being placed on the market. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/about.htm">Read about <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> legislation on the <abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>For some products, such as textiles, a prior surveillance import licence may be needed. Such licences are used to monitor future imports and change frequently. For the latest information on prior surveillance licences, <a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/europeandtrade/importing-into-uk/import-licensing/notices-to-importers/page22864.html/importing-into-uk/import-licensing/notices-to-importers/page22864.html">read the ‘Notices to Importers’ section on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>A full list of import restrictions and prohibitions is listed in volume 1, part 3 of the Integrated Tariff. </p>

<h2 id="major-export-licences-permits-and-certificates">Major export licences, permits and certificates</h2>

<p>When you export, identify the commodity code for your goods to find out if you need a licence. You can do this using the UK Integrated Tariff (the Tariff). A full list of commodity codes is available in volume 2.</p>

<p>Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) licences are required for exporting raw or processed food and are issued and controlled by the Rural Payments Agency. Read about <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> export procedures in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trading-in-common-agricultural-policy-goods">Preparing to trade in <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods.</a></p>

<p>You will require an export licence issued by the Export Control Organisation (ECO), part of the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> for weapons and other strategic goods with a potential military use, called ‘dual-use’ products. Trafficking and brokering - including warehousing and shipping - either military or dual-use strategic goods also carries restrictions.</p>

<p>All military controlled items and some highly sensitive dual-use goods and goods subject to end-use controls need a licence, even if the export is made to another EU country.</p>

<p>Less sensitive controlled dual-use goods exports need a licence if shipped outside the EU.</p>

<p>To find out about strategic export controls, see the guide on the Export Controls.</p>

<h3 id="import-licence-quotas">Import licence quotas</h3>

<p>These relate to set amounts or values of particular goods under reduced customs duties for a limited period. For example, many agricultural commodities cannot be imported into the EU without a valid licence. Licences may also be used to restrict imports by imposing quantitative limits. However licences may also allow a reduced rate of duty on the goods they cover. Such licences are usually issued against financial security. Licences issued in other member states are valid in the UK. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_007783&amp;propertyType=document">Find information about licence quotas on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="the-tariff">The Tariff</h3>

<p>To find out whether you need a licence for your product you should first identify its commodity code. A full list of commodity codes is available in volume 2 of the UK Integrated Tariff. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">online UK Trade Tariff tool.</a></p>
</div>

<h2 id="tariff-quotas">Tariff quotas</h2>

<p>Trading schemes throughout the EU exist to control the import and export of certain goods with the aim of boosting business opportunities for member states. Tariff quotas are an EU mechanism for importing limited supplies of specific goods at a reduced or nil rate of customs duty. When the quota runs out, the duty rate returns to normal. When you claim a quota, you can reduce your customs duty, agricultural levies and/or Common Agricultural Policies charges.</p>

<p>The limits in a quota can be set on the quantity, value, volume or weight of the goods, or the time period over which it operates.</p>

<p>Non-licence quota duty reductions are given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Quotas are administered in the UK by the Central Tariff Quota Unit. <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/databases/quota/index_en.htm">Find out about EU quota balances and check currently available tariff shares on the Europa website.</a> To make a claim for a tariff quota share you may require an EUR1, <abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr> form A, or ATR Preference Certificate. You may need to provide financial security if the quota is nearing exhaustion.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000242">Find detailed information about tariff quotas on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="working-with-import-and-export-preferences">Working with import and export preferences</h2>

<p>Take advantage of schemes that allow you to import or export at low or nil rates of duty. The EU has a range of preferential trade agreements with third countries, ie countries outside the EU. The agreements enable trading at a reduced rate of duty, or duty-free. To take part in one of these schemes you must ‘claim a preference’.</p>

<p>Import preferences allow a wide range of products from outside the EU to be imported into the EU at a reduced or nil rate of duty. See the guide on importing and exporting using trade preferences.</p>

<p>Export preference arrangements also exist with a number of third countries which in turn grant preferential rates of duty to goods originating in the EU. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_PublicNoticesAndInfoSheets&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000182">Read about European Community Preferences: Export Procedures in Notice 827 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>For you to qualify for import and export preference schemes, your products must comply with strict rules of origin. For more information, read the guide on rules of origin.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-preference-scheme">Types of preference scheme</h3>

<p>There are two types - autonomous or non-reciprocal, such as the Generalised System of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>), and reciprocal, such as the agreements between the EU and South Africa, Chile, Mexico, Mediterranean countries and European Free Trade Association.</p>

<p>To claim a preference, you’ll need to prove the origin of your goods using one of these forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr> FORM A - must be used to support claims to preference from <abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries</li>
  <li>EUR 1 Certificate or EUR-MED - must be held or issued for imports and exports under all other preferential arrangements
<a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_PublicNoticesAndInfoSheets&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000182">Find out about EUR1 in Notice 827 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically worded origin declarations and invoices or other commercial documents can be issued or presented for low-value consignments in both the autonomous and reciprocal arrangements. Certain reciprocal preference arrangements also allow approved exporters to issue invoice declarations for consignments of any value.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-your-intellectual-property-rights">Protecting your intellectual property rights</h2>

<p>It is important that you protect your intellectual property (<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>) and take action if you suspect someone is infringing your rights.</p>

<p><abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> legislation exists to protect your intellectual property, whether it is a patent, design, trade mark or copyright. It prevents anyone from profiting from your <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>, whether in the UK or abroad. The legislation also aims to protect the public from fake products which endanger their health and safety, or from being misled.</p>

<p>In order for action to be taken to protect your <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights, you must first of all make sure that you have registered them. The Intellectual Property Office has produced a supply chain toolkit containing advice on how to protect your intellectual property rights. It also contains guidance on the steps you should take if you discover counterfeit goods in your supply chain. <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipctoolkit.pdf">Download the supply chain toolkit from the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) website (PDF, 349KB).</a></p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can help you if you suspect your business identity and products are being abused.</p>

<p>Goods considered as infringing <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> in international trade include:</p>

<ul>
<li>counterfeit goods - incorporating any symbol, goods or packaging carrying or portraying a trade mark without authorisation</li>
  <li>pirated goods - copies made without the consent of the copyright holder</li>
  <li>patent-infringing goods - cover infringements of a patent under UK law</li>
  <li>national or community plant variety right - covers infringements of plant varieties under UK and EU law</li>
  <li>designations of origin or geographical indications infringing goods</li>
</ul>
<p>If you suspect that goods arriving in the UK are infringing your <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights, you can submit a National Intellectual Property Rights Application and <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will take action. If the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> right in question needs protecting in two or more EU member states, use Community Intellectual Property Rights Application.</p>

<p>In both cases, you must prove you hold the rights to use the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> you are asking <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to protect. <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/counterfeit_piracy/right_holders/index_en.htm">Find downloadable versions of the National and Community Intellectual Property Rights Application forms on the Europa website.</a></p>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> rejects your application you are entitled to an explanation and a request for further investigation. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000244&amp;propertyType=document">Read about procedures for <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights infringements on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>
