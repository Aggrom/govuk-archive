</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re having difficulties making your mortgage repayments and are in danger of becoming homeless, you could get financial help to stay in your home. This is called the Mortgage Rescue Scheme.</p>

<p>It’s a last resort after you’ve tried all other options to make your repayments easier - talk to your lender first. </p>

<p>What you get depends on your circumstances. You apply through your local council. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The scheme is only available in England. If you’re in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, <a href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="contact your local council" rel="external">contact your local council</a> to find out about similar schemes.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>When you apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the council will arrange for you to meet a money adviser if you haven’t already</li>
  <li>they may also arrange an assessment of your home</li>
  <li>you’ll get advice and a plan to help you manage your debt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Financial help</h2>

<p>There are 2 kinds of financial help. With both, the council involves a Registered Social Landlord (<abbr title="Registered Social Landlord">RSL</abbr>). This is an independent housing organisation.</p>

<h3>Equity loan</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Registered Social Landlord">RSL</abbr> provides an interest-only loan to help pay off some of your mortgage and reduce payments to an affordable level. You need no more than 40% equity in your property to qualify for this. </p>

<h3>Government mortgage to rent</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Registered Social Landlord">RSL</abbr> buys your home for 90% of its market value. You’ll stay in your home and pay rent to the <abbr title="Registered Social Landlord">RSL</abbr>. The rent will be 20% less than the market rate for your area.</p>
