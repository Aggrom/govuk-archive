This is called the Mortgage Rescue Scheme.\r\n\r\nIt's a last resort after you've tried all other options to make your repayments easier - talk to your lender first. \r\n\r\nWhat you get depends on your circumstances.

With both, the council involves a Registered Social Landlord (RSL). This is an independent housing organisation.\r\n\r\n###Equity loan\r\n\r\nThe RSL provides an interest-only loan to help pay off some of your mortgage and reduce payments to an affordable level. You need no more than 40% equity in your property to qualify for this. \r\n\r\n###Government mortgage to rent\r\n\r\nThe RSL buys your home for 90% of its market value. You'll stay in your home and pay rent to the RSL. The rent will be 20% less than the market rate for your area.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n[Download 'Mortgage Rescue Scheme: what will it mean for me and my family?'
