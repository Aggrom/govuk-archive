</article><article id="what-the-assessment-involves"><header><h1>Part 5: What the assessment involves</h1>
  </header><p>The compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr>) instructor assessment assesses your ability to:</p>

<ul>
<li>train learner motorcyclists in the requirements of <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>train and guide other instructors within an approved training body</li>
</ul>
<p>There will usually be 2 other instructors taking the assessment at the same time as you. </p>

<p>The Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) assessor will play the role of a novice rider throughout the assessment.</p>

<p>You’ll be asked to deliver lessons based on the topics being assessed. One or both of the other instructors will act as your supervisor. You’ll then swap the roles of the instructor and supervisor. </p>

<h2>Eyesight test</h2>

<p>You’ll have to pass an eyesight test before the assessment starts. You’ll have to read a number plate from a distance of:</p>

<ul>
<li>26.5 metres for vehicles with a new-style number plate</li>
  <li>27.5 metres for vehicles with an old-style number plate</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>New-style number plates start with two letters followed by two numbers, eg AB51 ABC.</p>
</div>

<p>The rest of the assessment won’t go ahead if you fail the eyesight test.</p>

<h2>Session 1</h2>

<p>This session focuses on element A of the <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> syllabus - introduction to <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> assessor will give you an overview of the assessment.</p>

<p>You’ll then deliver a lesson on the modules within element A of the <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> syllabus. You’re allowed to use notes and training aids. The other candidates will watch your instruction and decide whether it’s valid and achieves the objective.</p>

<h2>Session 2</h2>

<p>This session focuses on element B of the <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> syllabus - practical on-site training.</p>

<p>You’ll be introduced to the motorcycle that will be used on-site. You should familiarise yourself with it so you can give a controls lesson or basic machine check lesson.</p>

<p>The ‘novice rider’ will act on the instruction you give. The other candidates will watch the instruction you give and decide whether it’s a valid lesson and achieves the objective.</p>

<h2>Sessions 3 and 4</h2>

<p>These sessions focus on element C of the <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> syllabus - practical on-site riding.</p>

<p>You’ll instruct the ‘novice rider’. The other candidates give a debrief at the end of each lesson. </p>

<p>The roles will be changed several times so you can prove your ability as an instructor and supervisor.</p>

<h2>Session 5</h2>

<p>This session focuses on element D of the <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> syllabus - practical on-road training.</p>

<p>You’ll give a lesson made up of 3 modules from element D. The other candidates will supervise you, and then the roles will be swapped. </p>

<h2>Sessions 6 and 7</h2>

<p>These sessions focus on element E of the <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> syllabus - practical on-road riding.</p>

<p>You’ll ride a motorcycle and follow the ‘novice rider’ on the road. You’ll have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>give instructions</li>
  <li>correct any faults that they make </li>
  <li>direct them over a route on public roads using radio equipment</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to use your own motorcycle for sessions 6 and 7.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="your-assessment-result"><header><h1>Part 6: Your assessment result</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll be given your result and a debrief at the end of the assessment by the assessor. You’ll be sent confirmation of your result by post.</p>

<h2>Passing the assessment</h2>

<p>You’ll be sent more information about how to apply to the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) for registration as a <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> assessed instructor. </p>

<p>Until you’ve got your registration certificate you aren’t allowed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>conduct compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr>) courses</li>
  <li>train any instructors on behalf of your approved training body</li>
</ul>
<h2>Failing the assessment</h2>

<p>You can’t apply to retake the assessment if you fail it twice within a 12-month period. You’ll have to wait until 1 year after the date of the second assessment before applying again.</p>

<h3>Failing if you’re a down-trained instructor</h3>

<p>You can continue to give <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> training if you’re  a down-trained instructor, but you’ll have to have a standards check at your ATB in the near  future.</p>
