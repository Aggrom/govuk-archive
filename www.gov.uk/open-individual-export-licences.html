<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you want to export controlled goods, such as military or ‘dual-use’ items, to specific countries, you will need an export licence from the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>).</p>

<p>An Open Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>) is a type of licence issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> which is more flexible and tailored to an exporter’s needs. <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> allow a named exporter to export multiple shipments of specific goods to specific destinations, subject to meeting detailed terms and conditions.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> can potentially save you time and money so, if you meet the eligibility criteria, you should give serious consideration to making an application.</p>

<p><abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> cover multiple shipments of specific controlled goods to named destinations. They may also name the consignees or end users of the goods concerned - unlike Standard Individual Export Licences (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences">SIELs</abbr>), which always name these parties. For more information, read the guide on Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs).</p>

<p>There are no open individual transhipment licences, which means that controlled goods cannot be imported into the UK for export elsewhere under an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>. You can find more information on transhipment licences in the guide on transhipment licences.</p>

<p>Controlled goods are items of strategic importance, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>dual-use goods (military and civilian)</li>
  <li>torture goods</li>
  <li>radioactive sources</li>
  <li>military goods</li>
  <li>electronic technology</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various categories of <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> which you might be able to apply for, depending on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the nature of your business</li>
  <li>your track record in applying for export licences </li>
  <li>the conditions of the licence</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eligibility-for-an-oiel">Eligibility for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> are issued by <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> on a concessionary basis. To justify applying for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, you must be an exporter with:</p>

<ul>
<li>a record of at least 20 relevant <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> applications in the previous year for exports that you now wish to cover on an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</li>
  <li>where this is not possible (for example, because your application relates to new business), you need a good business case to support your application</li>
</ul>
<p>Your business case needs to set out how many exports you anticipate making in the next year, of what nature and to which destinations. You must provide evidence (such as contract excerpts) to back up your case and you should ensure that it is carefully considered and not simply an extensive wish list of countries.</p>

<h3 id="criteria-for-renewing-an-oiel">Criteria for renewing an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you already hold an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> and want to renew your coverage, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will expect you to have used it at least 20 times during the previous year. For dealer-to-dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>, usage of at least six times a year is acceptable. You will also be expected to meet the original criteria for use as detailed in your business case application.</p>

<h3 id="rejection-of-oiel-applications">Rejection of <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> applications</h3>

<p>Typical reasons why <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> applications might be rejected include:</p>

<ul>
<li>failure to include adequate goods descriptions</li>
  <li>inclusion of unrealistic country lists</li>
  <li>failure to provide an adequate business case</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the guide on common pitfalls to avoid in export licence applications.</p>

<p>You should be aware that there is no formal appeal procedure if your <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> application is rejected. If this happens, you will need to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-a-siel">Applying for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you have had an application for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> rejected by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, you can still apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>, covering some or all of the same destinations and goods.</p>

<p>When considering a new <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> application, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will take into account any factors that influenced its decision on the original <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs).</p>

<h3 id="recommendations-when-applying-for-an-oiel">Recommendations when applying for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Although an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> is a more flexible export licence, it is not an authorisation to apply for a wide range of countries or goods. You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>be careful and realistic in identifying which goods are to be exported to destinations</li>
  <li>be careful in applying for ‘sensitive’ destinations - as a guide, if a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> is denied to a specific destination, it is likely that this export destination, if requested on an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> will also be denied</li>
  <li>try to avoid making one application for a wide range of goods to multiple destinations - you should make separate applications for fewer countries, for example groups of countries in different regions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="essentials-in-making-your-oiel-application">Essentials in making your <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> application</h3>

<p>Your OEIL application must:</p>

<ul>
<li>include detailed technical information about the goods being exported</li>
  <li>be supported by the provision of consignee undertakings from your end-user</li>
</ul>
<p>You are usually not required to provide consignee or end-user details up front at the time of application. However, you do need to obtain the undertaking before the goods are shipped and ensure the undertaking is valid when the shipment is made. You must retain and produce original versions of consignee undertakings for compliance audits.</p>

<p>In a consignee undertaking, the consignee is asked to confirm the nature of the goods ordered, what they will be used for and that they will not be re-exported or incorporated into goods which will subsequently be exported to a destination outside that permitted by the licence. They are also asked to declare that the goods will not be used for activities associated with weapons of mass destruction (<abbr title="Weapons of mass destruction">WMD</abbr>).</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on End-User and Consignee Undertakings for SIELs and OIELs.</p>

<h3 id="processing-times-for-oiels">Processing Times for <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> has an informal target of processing 60% of <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> applications within 60 working days. Formal targets do not apply to the processing of <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> because of the wide variation in goods, activities and destinations covered by such licences and the need for case by case judgements on each application.</p>

<p>For more information see guidance on <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s Annual Report Targets.</p>

<h2 id="types-and-duration-of-oiel">Types and duration of <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are six main types of <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>military</li>
  <li>dual-use</li>
  <li>dealer</li>
  <li>UK continental shelf</li>
  <li>media</li>
  <li>cryptographic</li>
</ul>
<p>These categories broadly cover exporters of goods on the government’s UK Strategic Export Control Lists including: firearms and ammunition dealers, exporters to UK continental shelf installations such as oil platforms, media and similar companies exporting protection equipment, and suppliers of cryptographic technology.</p>

<h3 id="military-and-dual-use-oiels">Military and dual-use <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>These allow you to export items and technology on the government’s strategic export control lists. They are usually valid for five years.</p>

<p>Find out more about the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items in the guide on the UK Strategic Export Control Lists.</p>

<h3 id="dealer-oiels">Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> are valid for up to three years, and can be used by UK-registered firearms dealers to export approved types of firearms and ammunition to other gun dealers within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. At least two working days before each shipment, dealers must send copies of a valid EC5 dealer-to-dealer form to the Home Office. The form can be faxed to 0870 336 9030.</p>

<p>If you want to send firearms and ammunition to any other consignee in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, you should apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> - you can find out more in the guide on Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs).</p>

<p>You must hold a certificate under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 if you want to exhibit, demonstrate or export temporarily or permanently any item listed under Category B of the EC Directive on the Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Weapons (91/474/EEC).</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on firearms and EC forms.</p>

<h3 id="uk-continental-shelf-oiels">UK Continental Shelf <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>This <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> authorises the export of controlled items for use exclusively in offshore installations and associated vessels within the UK sector of the continental shelf. Continental shelf <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> are valid for five years.</p>

<h3 id="media-oiels">Media <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>This category covers equipment used for protection by journalists and aid workers working abroad, such as in areas of conflict.</p>

<p>Items covered by a media <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>military helmets</li>
  <li>body armour</li>
  <li>bullet-proof or bullet-resistant clothing</li>
  <li>nuclear, biological and chemical protective items</li>
  <li>non-military four-wheel drive civilian vehicles with ballistic protection</li>
  <li>flak suits</li>
  <li>specially designed components for any of the above items</li>
</ul>
<p>If you export items under a media <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, you must ensure they are returned to the UK when no longer needed. Media <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> are usually valid for five years.</p>

<h3 id="cryptographic-oiels">Cryptographic <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>This licence can be used by exporters of certain cryptography hardware or software and those transferring certain cryptography technology.The licence is usually valid for up to five years.

  <li>in an application designed for business use</li>
  <li>by a group undertaking of the licensee</li>
  <li>in medical devices</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> may also cover the export of cryptographic items, which have been incorporated prior to export, into items for medical end-use.</p>

<p>The licence does not cover and cannot be used for the export:</p>

<ul>
<li>of hardware, software or technology which have cryptanalytic functions</li>
  <li>of any item with a security grading above Unclassified</li>
  <li>of items that are intended or likely to be used for military purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>Cryptographic <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> are not needed for exports to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states or countries covered by the Community General Export Authorisation (<abbr title="Community General Export Authorisation">CGEA</abbr>). See the guide on the community general export authorisation.</p>

<p>Where a destination is prohibited for other reasons, cryptographic <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> do not apply.</p>

<p>For more information about destinations subject to sanctions, see the guide on current arms embargoes and other restrictions.</p>

<p>Further separate guidance is available on what cryptography is exempt from export licensing requirements. These details are outlined in the guide on the export of cryptographic items.</p>

<h2 id="important-conditions-relating-to-an-oiel">Important conditions relating to an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Each <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> includes both standard conditions and may have additional specific provisions. You should read and follow all the conditions carefully, otherwise you may make unlicensed shipments and risk the licence being revoked.</p>

<p>Standard provisions include:</p>

<h3 id="requirement-to-hold-consignee-undertakings-and-keep-accurate-records">Requirement to hold Consignee Undertakings and keep accurate records</h3>

<p>If you hold an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, you must obtain a written Consignee Undertaking that the goods are not intended for re-export to a destination not listed as permitted on the licence. The undertakings need to be received from each consignee before the first export. You should also remember to:</p>

<ul>
<li>retain the original undertaking (which must be signed and dated)</li>
  <li>obtain an undertaking (in advance) if the contract or project is ongoing</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of transfers to governments, a purchase order or contract can be accepted in place of an undertaking.</p>

<p>You must also keep records of all shipments of your goods for the period of the licence. These records must be made available for inspection by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) officials at an <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> compliance audit.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on end-user and consignee undertakings for SIELs and OIELs.</p>

<h3 id="conditions-relating-to-specific-use-of-goods">Conditions relating to specific use of goods</h3>

<p>You cannot export controlled goods under an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> if you are aware, or have been informed by the authorities, that the goods will be used in connection with:</p>

<ul>
<li>chemical, biological or nuclear weapons</li>
  <li>other nuclear explosive devices</li>
  <li>missiles capable of delivering such weapons</li>
</ul>
<p>Under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations, dual-use items may not be exported using an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> if intended for military end-use.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on Military End-Use control guidance notes.</p>

<h3 id="other-standard-conditions">Other Standard Conditions</h3>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>no items may be exported to a destination within a ‘Customs Free Zone’</li>
  <li>for intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> transfers a copy of the licence must accompany the items to their destination</li>
  <li>Ministry of Defence approval is required for exhibition of UK Military List items</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="temporary-oiel-conditions">Temporary <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> conditions</h3>

<p>If you require an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> in order to make temporary exports, you need to return any goods to the UK within 12 months of export.</p>

<p><abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> issued for temporary shipments might be granted for demonstration or exhibition purposes. Goods exported under these conditions must not be disposed of while abroad.</p>

<p>If the goods are part of a permanent exhibition, you will need to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>, if the <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> does not provide for this. For more information, see the guide on standard individual export licences.</p>

<h2 id="changing-details-and-extending-an-oiel">Changing details (and extending) an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> are not transferable and cannot be altered, except with the permission of the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<p>The main permitted changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the exporter’s change of address</li>
  <li>the consignee’s change of name or address</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-changes-to-oiels">Minor changes to <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>During your licence period, you may request small changes to your <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> without having to submit a new application. These include the:</p>

<ul>
<li>name or address of existing consignee and/or end user already (documentary evidence required)</li>
  <li>new consignee for a destination which is already on the licence</li>
  <li>colour of the equipment listed in licence</li>
  <li>part number of the exact same good</li>
  <li>increase in value of goods</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will not amend a licence if:</p>

<ul>
<li>there is a new destination</li>
  <li>there is a new end user</li>
  <li>the goods have changed</li>
  <li>there is an increased quantity of goods</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-to-oiel-holders-name-or-address">Changes to <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> holder’s name or address</h3>

<p>If your business changes its name, you should write to the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, including the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> licence number(s) affected</li>
  <li>your new company name/address</li>
  <li>the name and address of new owner, if applicable</li>
  <li>the new Companies House registration number, if applicable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="requesting-oiel-changes">Requesting <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> changes</h3>

<p>To request changes to your <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, you should contact the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> case officer who initially issued the <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>. Case officer contact details are published on SPIRE, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s export licensing database. </p>

<h3 id="extending-oiel-validity-periods">Extending <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> validity periods</h3>

<p>You can ask the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> to extend the period of an existing <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> for up to six months - as long as you previously submitted a new <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> application covering similar goods and destinations.</p>

<p>You should submit your request for an extended validity period along with the new <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> application using the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s SPIRE electronic application system. Alternatively, you can add a cover letter to your new application. Requests should be made at least eight weeks before the existing licence ends.</p>

<h2 id="complying-with-oiel-conditions">Complying with <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> conditions</h2>

<p>If you hold an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, you must satisfy the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> that you are complying with all the procedures needed for using the licence, including familiarity with current export legislation.</p>

<p>To check this, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will undertake a compliance audit of your business - usually within three months of your first <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> being granted. The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> also uses audits to check whether businesses are exporting goods or technology with an appropriate licence.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on compliance and enforcement of export controls.</p>

<h3 id="timing-of-compliance-audits">Timing of compliance audits</h3>

<p>Compliance audits take place within a few months of your company being granted its first open licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> or OGEL) and thereafter at intervals of between three and 36 months. Most exporters are visited every 12-18 months. The exact timing depends on the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s risk assessment of your business. This takes into account factors such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>volume of exports</li>
  <li>variety of licences used</li>
  <li>compliance record</li>
  <li>procedures in place</li>
  <li>goods exported and destinations on the licences</li>
  <li>any special conditions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reasons-for-revoking-an-oiel">Reasons for revoking an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The emphasis in an <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> compliance audit is to help businesses take action to comply with the licence requirements.</p>

<p>Remedial measures, if required, are usually set out in a warning letter, with a timescale for implementation. If you have failed to demonstrate a sufficient level of compliance, the warning letter will then be followed by a revisit to check whether you have taken the necessary action to ensure compliance.  If there has been little or no progress, <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> may consider suspending (or revoking) the relevant licence. In serious cases, HM Revenue &amp; Customs officials may decide to prosecute.</p>

<p>Most non-compliance issues found by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> relate to documentation errors. Typical issues found on compliance audits, which might lead to a licence being revoked, include:</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of sufficient procedures in administering company use of licences</li>
  <li>failure to keep adequate records as specified by the licence terms and conditions and as a result not being able to confirm correct usage of the licence</li>
  <li>records not being available</li>
  <li>failure to fully read all details of the licence</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot appeal against an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> revocation decision by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, due to the concessionary nature of the licence.</p>

<h3 id="penalties-for-non-compliance">Penalties for non-compliance</h3>

<p>Exporters should be aware that there are legal penalties for exporting controlled goods without a licence. This includes potential seizure of goods by customs, financial penalties or even a prison term.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/export-control-organisation/eco-notices-exporters">read about recent export control convictions on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="refusal-or-revocation-of-an-oiel">Refusal or revocation of an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you have had an application for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> rejected by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, you can still apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>, covering some or all of the same destinations and goods. You cannot appeal against an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> refusal or revocation decision by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, due to the concessionary nature of the licence.</p>

<p><abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> cover multiple shipments of specific controlled goods to named destinations, and are issued to individual exporters. The consignee or end user of the goods on an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> are not always named. They must, however, be specified on a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs).</p>

<p>When considering a new <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> application, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will take into account any factors that influenced its decision on the original <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="relevant-legislation-for-oiels">Relevant legislation for <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The export control licensing regime in the UK is based on both UK national and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws (applicable across all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member countries).</p>

<h3 id="export-control-order-2008">Export Control Order 2008</h3>

<p>Export regulations in the UK are implemented under Export Control Order 2008. This secondary legislation is based on the Export Control Act 2002 - the UK’s main legislation on export controls.</p>

<p>Areas covered by the order include:</p>

<ul>
<li>strategic goods export controls</li>
  <li>transfer of technology and technical assistance provision</li>
  <li>controls on trade in military equipment between overseas countries where part of the process takes place in the UK</li>
  <li>controls on trade with embargoed destinations, eg embargoes imposed by the UK following <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe embargoes</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guide on the Export Control Order 2008.</p>

<h3 id="dual-use-regulation">Dual-use regulation</h3>

<p>The main European legislation is Council Regulation (EC) No.428/2009 (the re-cast dual-use regulation), which set up a <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> system to control exports of dual-use items and technology.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on controls on dual-use goods (EU Dual-Use Regulation).</p>

<p>Under the regulations, <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> and similar permits issued in one member state can normally be used to export from other member states.</p>

<p>You do not need a licence to export most dual-use items, to other member states, unless the goods are intended to be forwarded to a third country.</p>

<p>Dual-use items include:</p>

<ul>
<li>software and technology with civil and military applications</li>
  <li>goods that can be used for non-explosive uses or in the manufacture of nuclear explosive devices</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine which military and dual-use items are subject to export control legislation, you need to check the UK Strategic Export Control Lists. You can find more information and also download a copy of the lists from the guide on the UK Strategic Export Control Lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items.</p>

<p>If your goods are listed on the Control Lists then you will need to apply for an appropriate licence. If you are unsure if your items are listed, then you can download the guidance about how to determine if your goods need an export licence. This guide includes information on database tools and advice to help you self-rate your goods as well information on training courses provided by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-oiels">Frequently asked questions about <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h2>

<h3 id="under-what-circumstances-will-an-oiel-be-issued">1. Under what circumstances will an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> be issued?</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> is a concessionary form of licence, and are issued depending on the circumstances. The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> usually look for a minimum of 20 <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> applications per year. They will, however, also consider applications if there is a business case detailing why an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> is the most appropriate licence.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-get-an-oiel">2. How long does it take to get an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> aims to process 60 per cent of <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> applications within 60 working days. We advise that you should envisage a timescale of three to six months for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> to be issued.</p>

<h3 id="can-an-oiel-be-amended-to-include-additional-goods-or-destinations">3. Can an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> be amended to include additional goods or destinations?</h3>

<p>No. You would need to apply for a new <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> to incorporate both the existing and new goods and/or destinations. When the new <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> has been re-issued, <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will cancel the old one. </p>

<h3 id="can-an-oiel-application-be-made-before-all-consignee-or-end-user-details-are-known">4. Can an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> application be made before all consignee or end-user details are known?</h3>

<p>Yes. If you are applying for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> then you are not required to obtain consignee or end-user details up front at the time of application. You will however need to obtain the details within a month of receiving the goods. You will need to keep and produce originals (not copies) of the required documentation for Compliance Audits. You will also need to ensure that the undertaking is not out of date when the shipment is made.</p>
