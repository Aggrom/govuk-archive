<p>Competitive markets provide the best means of ensuring that the economy’s resources are put to their best use by encouraging enterprise and efficiency, widening choice and contributing to our international competitiveness.</p>

<p>However, timely and effective enforcement is essential to identify any anti-competitive practices or structures that may develop and lead to a <a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/general/oft911.pdf">loss of competition in markets</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/speeches/spe0304.pdf">abuse of market power</a>.</p>

<h2 id="current-competition-authorities">Current competition authorities</h2>

<p>Whilst the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills sets the overall policy framework for competition, it is regulated by the UK’s independent competition authorities.</p>

<p>4 main competition bodies are responsible for investigating and enforcing decisions on competition matters in the UK market:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/">Office of Fair Trading</a> (<abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>) is the principal competition authority whose responsibility is to enforce competition and make markets work well for the benefit of consumers. The <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> derives most of its powers from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents">Enterprise Act 2002</a> and the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/41/contents">Competition Act 1998</a>. The <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> investigates mergers and anti-competitive practices in markets and also enforces consumer law – see “<a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/competition_law/oft442.pdf">Modernisation – Understanding Competition Law</a>”. Large mergers with a European dimension may be covered by the European Community Merger Regulation (ECMR). </li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/">Competition Commission</a> (<abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr>) conducts in-depth inquiries into mergers, markets and the regulation of certain industries such as utilities and communications. However, the <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> only undertakes its inquiries where they have been referred to it by the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>, one of the sectoral regulators [Link to section below] or in exceptional circumstances the Secretary of State.</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.catribunal.org.uk/">Competition Appeal Tribunal</a> (CAT) is a specialist judicial body whose function is to hear and rule on appeals of decisions made by the competition authorities. The CAT has a cross-disciplinary expertise in law, economics, business, competition and economic regulatory issues.</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html">European Commission</a> (Directorate General for Competition) has exclusive powers to act on certain large mergers with a European dimension. It also has powers to investigate anti-competitive practices when trade between members of the European Community, or in some cases the European Economic Area (EEA), is affected. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sectoral-regulators">Sectoral regulators</h3>

<p>A number of Sectoral Regulators have a specific role in promoting or facilitating competition within their sectors. Some also have the power to apply the Competition Act 1998 concurrently with the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>. The regulators with such ‘concurrent powers’ are: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/OfgemHome.aspx">Ofgem</a> - in the energy markets </li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/">Ofwat</a> - in the water industry</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/">Ofcom</a> - in the communications sector </li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/">ORR</a> - for railway services </li>

</ul>
<h2 id="oft-market-studies-and-cc-market-investigations">
<abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> market studies and <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> market investigations</h2>

<p>Office of Fair Trading (<abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>) market studies are detailed investigations of markets that are not operating well for consumers but where neither consumer regulation enforcement by the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> nor competition enforcement through a referral to the Competition Commission (<abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr>) is likely to resolve the issues. </p>

<p>Where those studies make recommendations to government. the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) co-ordinates government responses and ensures that they take account not only of competition and consumer interests but wider public policy objectives. </p>

<p>Market studies will usually be performed under section 5 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020040_en_1">Enterprise Act 2002</a> in order to identify whether perceived problems should be addressed through the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>’s other functions. There is a range of possible outcomes of a study including:</p>

<ul>
<li>giving the market a clean bill of health (ie a decision that intervention is not appropriate on the evidence available) </li>
  <li>publishing information to help consumers </li>
  <li>encouraging firms to take voluntary action </li>
  <li>encouraging a consumer code of practice </li>
  <li>making recommendations to the Government or regulators </li>
  <li>investigation or enforcement action against companies or individuals suspected of breaching consumer law or competition law </li>
  <li>a market investigation reference to the Competition Commission</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> conducts in-depth inquiries into markets – market investigations – undertaken in response to a reference made by the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> or sectoral regulator and, in certain limited circumstances, by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.
The market studies and market investigations where BIS has played an active role are:</p>

<ul>
<li>medicines distribution </li>
  <li>pharmaceutical price regulation </li>
  <li>sale and rent back </li>
  <li>Payment Protection Insurance </li>
  <li>supply of airport services in the UK by BAA </li>
  <li>rolling stock leasing (ROSCOs) </li>
  <li>property searches </li>
  <li>commercial use of public information (CUPI) </li>
  <li>supply of groceries in the UK </li>
</ul>
<p>To find information on these and other market studies, go to the <a rel="external" href="http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20090703093314/http:/www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/businesslaw/competition/market-studies/page17610.html">National Archives market studies pages</a>. </p>

<h2 id="mergers">Mergers</h2>

<p>A proper framework for control of mergers is important to ensure that competition is not damaged when businesses come together. UK mergers are considered by the competition authorities under the Enterprise Act 2002. Public interest considerations are specified in the Act as being national security, media plurality and stability of the UK financial system.</p>

<p>Generally, mergers will be considered by the UK competition authorities if the annual UK turnover of the enterprise being taken over exceeds £70 million, or the merger creates a 25% share or more in a market for goods or services in the UK or a substantial part of it. There is no statutory requirement to pre-notify mergers to the UK competition authorities.</p>

<h3 id="investigation-by-the-oft">Investigation by the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> investigates mergers in the first instance and, with the exception of public interest cases, decides whether or not they should be referred to the <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> for further investigation. The test is whether the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> believes a merger has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition.
In making decisions, the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> will either:</p>

<ol>
<li>refer to the <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> for further investigation</li>
  <li>clear the merger</li>
  <li>clear it subject to undertakings in lieu of a reference to the <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Details of mergers investigated by the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/"><abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="investigation-by-the-cc">Investigation by the <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Where a merger is referred to the <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr>, it has to determine whether it has resulted in a substantial lessening of competition and to take the action it considers reasonable and practicable to address any adverse effects arising from the merger.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> reports are published. Details of mergers investigated by the <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/">Competition Commission</a> website. Companies can also obtain <a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/">guidance</a> and informal advice from the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> on its merger procedures.</p>

<h3 id="mergers-between-water-and-sewerage-companies">Mergers between water and sewerage companies</h3>

<p>A special regime exists for mergers between water and sewerage companies. These are considered under sections 32-35 of the Water Industry Act 1991, as amended by the Enterprise Act and the Water Act.</p>

<h3 id="european-community-merger-regulation">European Community Merger Regulation</h3>

<p>Large mergers with a European dimension that breach certain jurisdictional thresholds of the European Community Merger Regulation (ECMR) – Council Regulation No. 139/2004 – fall to the European Commission for investigation.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking mergers involving enterprises with an aggregate worldwide turnover of more than Euro 5bn (around £4bn) and where the aggregate Community-wide turnover of each of at least two of the enterprises concerned is more than Euro 250m (around £200m) will be investigated by the European Commission taking into account the views of Member States.</p>

<p>However, those mergers where more than two-thirds of the Community-wide turnover of each enterprise concerned falls within one and the same Member State, are not caught by the EC Merger Regulation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> will normally advise the EC on competition issues it sees relevant to cases being considered under the EC Merger Regulation.</p>

<p>Information on individual cases under the ECMR can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html">Commission’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Public interest cases under the EC Merger Regulation</p>

<p>The Secretary of State may also intervene on public interest grounds in mergers being considered under the EC Merger Regulation, where the public interest consideration in question is also recognised in the EC Merger Regulation. In such cases the European Commission will continue to consider the competition issues whilst the UK authorities consider public interest aspects.</p>

<h2 id="new-processes-and-competition-authorities-from-april-2014">New processes and competition authorities from April 2014</h2>

<p>The Government’s 2011 <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/competition-regime-for-growth">consultation on competition reform</a> confirmed that many aspects of the UK’s competition regime are world class but it also highlighted some significant challenges for the current system and made a number of proposals to enhance the regime’s performance. The <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>, published in March 2012, set out the reforms that will come into effect from April 2014.</p>

<p>These reforms – currently being considered by Parliament in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill – will bring together the best of the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> and <abbr title="Competition Commission">CC</abbr> into a single Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to become a world-leading competition authority, advocating competition both at home and abroad. It will have a greater role in ensuring competition in regulated sectors is being addressed, through enhanced cooperation and information sharing between itself and the sector regulators. It will make better use of public resources, and business will benefit from having a single agency to deal with. </p>

<h3 id="the-markets-and-mergers-regimes">The Markets and Mergers regimes</h3>

<p>When the CMA is set up, we shall maintain the separation of decision making between the two-phases of market and merger investigations [see page 94 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>]. Currently the two phases of an investigation are carried out by separate organisations: </p>

<ul>
<li>Phase 1, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/;jsessionid=8200B8DBE569E41858F3F97E2DFC0CAF"><abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr></a>, which can undertake an initial study into a merger or market to see if there is a competition issue to be addressed. If so, it can refer the case to:</li>
  <li>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/our-work">Competition Commission</a>, Phase 2, which will carry out a deeper study to get to the nub of the problem and impose remedies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The separation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 decision-making on regulatory appeals will also be maintained and provided for in legislation.</p>

<p>The CMA will have powers, additionally, to conduct investigations into practices that impact on more than one market [see page 30 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>], such as extended warranties and other secondary point of sale practices, without the need to make multiple market investigation references. These powers will enable the CMA to take a more targeted approach to tackling recurring sources of consumer complaints.</p>

<p>The CMA will have discretion to stop a proposed merger [see page 42 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>] where there are concerns the merger may be anti-competitive, and to consider with the companies involved whether the merger should be allowed to proceed. Legislation will clarify that the Authority can reverse mergers that have already taken place where this is deemed appropriate after investigation.</p>

<p>The Government also proposes to improve remedies by enabling the CMA to require parties to appoint an independent third party [see page 48 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>] to monitor, arbitrate, and/or implement remedies; and by giving the CMA the power to require parties to publish certain non-price information. </p>

<h3 id="streamlining-and-strengthening-the-competition-tools">Streamlining and strengthening the competition tools</h3>

<p>A minor change will give the Secretary of State the power to request the CMA to investigate public interest issues [see page 30of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>] alongside competition issues in a market investigation.</p>

<p>In order to ensure greater certainty and to reduce the burden to business, the Government proposes introducing or reducing statutory time limits at all stages of market investigations. This will be supported by information gathering powers at all stages. </p>

<p>Statutory time limits will also be introduced at all stages of the mergers process [see page 44of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>].</p>

<h3 id="anti-trust-and-cartels">Anti-trust and cartels</h3>

<p>The system for enforcing the legal prohibitions in anti-trust (abuse of market dominance and other anti-competitive agreements) and cartel cases (eg agreement between companies to fix prices) contained in the Competition Act 1998 (‘antitrust’) is being strengthened. Proposals include statutory change to bolster separation between investigation and decision making and new powers for the CMA to improve the efficiency of investigations and transparency of the decision making process [see page 54of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf">Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)</a>].</p>

<p>This is work currently carried out by the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>. Appeals against decisions by the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> (and the CMA once the reforms have been fully introduced) can be made to the Competition Appeal Tribunal</p>

<h3 id="sectoral-regulation-and-concurrency">Sectoral Regulation and ‘concurrency’</h3>

<p>Sectoral regulators already have the power to refer cases to the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> but rarely use them. We want to encourage the CMA to be a more proactive central resource for these regulators.</p>

<p>Some sectoral regulators have ‘concurrent competition powers’, ie: they have a choice between using their own sectoral powers and making use of the 1998 Competition Act to refer issues to the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>. We want to strengthen the primacy of the Competition Act by requiring sectoral regulators with concurrent powers to consider that route first; and also to give the CMA the power to take Competition Act cases from the sectoral regulators where it is better placed to proceed with the case.</p>

<h2 id="competition-complaints">Competition complaints</h2>
<p>If you believe a company or group of companies are acting anti-competitively, then you may wish to consider making a complaint to the <abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr> via its special hotline and email address for complaints under the Competition Act:</p>
