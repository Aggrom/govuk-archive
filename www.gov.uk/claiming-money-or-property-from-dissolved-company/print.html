  <li>shares</li>
  <li>intellectual property, eg trademarks, registered designs and patents</li>

  </header><p>If you’re owed money by a dissolved company, you can apply for a court order to have the company restored. This is the first step in trying to get your money back.</p>

<h2>Court order restoration</h2>

<ul>
<li>you did business with them </li>
  <li>you worked for them</li>
  <li>they owed you money when they were dissolved</li>
  <li>you’re responsible for their employee pension fund</li>
  <li>you have a shared or competing interest in land</li>
  <li>you were a shareholder or director when it was dissolved</li>
</ul>
<p>Except in cases of personal injury, you need to apply within 6 years of the company being dissolved.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can get <a href="/get-information-about-a-company" title="Get information about a dissolved company">information about a dissolved company</a> from Companies House.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>Use form N208 to apply for court order restoration in England and Wales.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://hmctsformfinder.bl.justice.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/n208-eng.pdf" title="Download 'Form 208, claim to restore by court order'" rel="external">Download ‘Form 208, claim to restore by court order’ (PDF, 117KB)</a></p>
</div>

<div class="form-download">

</div>

<p>Send your completed form to the nearest county court to the company’s registered office that deals with bankruptcy (select ‘County Court’ under ‘Search by court type’ in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="Her Majesty’s Courts &amp; Tribunal Service">court finder</a>), or the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/Search.do?court_id=716" title="Royal Courts of Justice">Royal Courts of Justice.</a></p>

<p>You’ll also need to include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the court fee (cash, postal order or cheque made payable to Her Majesty’s Courts &amp; Tribunal Service)</li>
  <li>a witness statement, containing the supporting information outlined in section 4 of the Treasury Solicitor’s guide to company restoration</li>

</div>

<h3>In Scotland</h3>

<p>Apply to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp?crt=sup_cos&amp;val=contact" title="Contact details for Scottish Court of Session">Court of Session</a> if initial value of the company’s shares that have been paid for (‘paid-up capital’) is more than £120,000.</p>

<p>For other companies, apply to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp" title="Scottish court locations">local sheriff court.</a></p>

<p>You’ll then have to serve a ‘petition to restore’ on the Registrar of Companies in Scotland, and any other bodies the court asks you to.</p>

<h3>In Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Apply by serving an ‘originating summons’ on the Royal Courts of Justice:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Royal Courts of Justice
<br>Chichester Street
<br>Belfast 
<br>BT1 3JY
<br></p></div></div>

<p>You also need to send this to the Registrar of Companies in Northern Ireland, along with a witness statement in support of the application.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

The Registrar of Companies
<br>Companies House
<br>Second Floor
<br>The Linenhall
<br>32-38 Linenhall Street
<br>Belfast 
<br>BT2 8BG
<br></p></div></div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Applying for court order restoration is complicated. You should <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/choosingandusing/findasolicitor.law" title="find a solicitor on the Law Society website" rel="external">get legal advice</a> before applying.</p>
</div>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>If your claim is accepted, the court will issue an Order to restore the company - you’ll be sent this, and you must send it on to the Registrar of Companies. Once they have it they will restore the company.</p>

<p>You’ll then need to take further action to try and get your money:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a ‘judgment’ from court for the amount of the money you’re owed together with interest and costs</li>
  <li><a href="/statutory-demands" title="Issue a statutory demand">issue a statutory demand</a></li>
  <li><a href="/wind-up-a-company-that-owes-you-money" title="take out a winding up petition">take out a winding up petition</a></li>
</ul></article><article id="buying-a-dissolved-companys-assets"><header><h1>Part 3: Buying a dissolved company's assets</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to claim or buy an asset belonging to a dissolved company, you may be able to do this by ‘referring’ the asset to the body representing the Crown. This depends on where the company was registered.</p>

<p>Anybody can refer an asset, including if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re the leaseholder of a property where the freehold was owned by the company</li>
  <li>you want to buy or are affected by land owned by the company</li>
  <li>you want to buy other assets held by the company like shares, trade marks or copyrights</li>
  <li>you’re a shareholder trying to get cash held by the company</li>
</ul>
