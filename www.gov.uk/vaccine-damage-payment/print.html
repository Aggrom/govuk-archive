  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re severely disabled as a result of a vaccination against certain diseases, you could get a one-off tax-free payment of £120,000. This is called a Vaccine Damage Payment. </p>

<h2>Effect on other benefits</h2>

<p>A Vaccine Damage Payment can affect other benefits and entitlements like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Child Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit</li>
  <li>Council Tax Benefit</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
</ul>
<p>The effect the payment will have depends on a number of things. This includes the payment being put into a trust and the payments being made from it.</p>

<p>You should let the office that deals with your benefit or tax credit claim know if you’ve got a Vaccine Damage Payment. You can get contact details from letters they have sent you.</p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>A Vaccine Damage Payment is a tax free one-off payment of  £120,000.</p>

<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>You’ll get payment direct to you or, if you’re under 18 or can’t manage your own affairs, payment will be made to trustees.</p>

<p>If you live with your family, your parents may be appointed as trustees.</p>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="how to have your benefits paid">into an account</a>, eg your bank account.</p>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You could get a payment if you’re severely disabled and your disability was caused by vaccination against any of the following diseases:</p>

<ul>
<li>diphtheria</li>
  <li>tetanus</li>
  <li>pertussis (whooping cough)</li>
  <li>poliomyelitis</li>
  <li>measles</li>
  <li>mumps</li>
  <li>rubella (German measles)</li>
  <li>tuberculosis (TB)</li>
  <li>haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB)</li>
  <li>meningococcal group C (meningitis C)</li>
  <li>pneumococcal infection</li>
  <li>human papillomavirus</li>
  <li>pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (swine flu) - up to 31 August 2010</li>
  <li>smallpox - up to 1 August 1971</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have had a combined vaccination against a number of the diseases listed. For example, you might have been vaccinated against DTP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) or MMR (measles, mumps and rubella).</p>

<p>You may also be able to get a payment if you’re severely disabled because either:</p>

<ul>
<li>your mother was vaccinated against one of the diseases in the list while she was pregnant</li>
  <li>you’ve been in close physical contact with someone who’s had an oral vaccine against poliomyelitis </li>
</ul>
<h2>What counts as ‘severely disabled’</h2>

<p>Disablement is worked out as a percentage, and ‘severe disablement’ means at least 60% disabled. </p>

<p>This could be a mental or physical disablement and will be based on medical evidence from the doctors or hospitals involved in your treatment.</p>

<h2>When and where the vaccination must have taken place</h2>

<p>You must normally have been vaccinated before your 18th birthday unless the vaccination was during an outbreak of disease in the UK or the Isle of Man, or it was against:</p>

<ul>
<li>poliomyelitis</li>
  <li>rubella</li>
  <li>Meningococcal Group C</li>
  <li>human papillomavirus</li>
  <li>pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (swine flu)</li>
</ul>
<p>The vaccination must have been given in the UK or the Isle of Man, unless you were vaccinated as part of Armed Forces medical treatment.</p>
