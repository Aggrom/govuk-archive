<h2>Your benefits</h2>

<p>If you get Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit you’ll get extra towards these (called a ‘carer premium’). </p>

<p>If you get the following benefits you’ll get Carer’s Allowance, but these benefits are then reduced by that amount: </p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Underlying entitlement</h2>

<p>You can’t normally get 2 income-replacement benefits (eg Carer’s Allowance and the State Pension) paid together. </p>

<p>This is called the ‘overlapping benefit rule’. If you can’t be paid Carer’s Allowance because of this rule, you have ‘underlying entitlement’ to Carer’s Allowance instead.</p>

<p>This might mean you could get:</p>

<ul>
<li>the carer premiums in Jobseeker’s Allowance and Income Support</li>
  <li>the extra amount for carers in Pension Credit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your State Pension</h2>

<p>Usually, for each week you get Carer’s Allowance or the underlying entitlement you also get: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/boost-state-pension" title="National Insurance Credits">National Insurance credits</a>  </li>
  <li>contributions to your <a href="/additional-state-pension" title="Additional State Pension">Additional State Pension</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Credits help to fill in any gaps in your National Insurance record. This can mean that you’ll still get the full State Pension and other benefits. These credits generally stop: </p>

<ul>
<li>in the tax year you reach State Pension age</li>
  <li>if you get the underlying entitlement and Widow’s Benefit or Bereavement Benefit</li>
</ul>
<h2>The person you care for</h2>

<p>Carer’s Allowance can affect the person you care for, eg their: </p>

<ul>
<li>severe disability premiums</li>
  <li>Pension Credit - severe disability element </li>
