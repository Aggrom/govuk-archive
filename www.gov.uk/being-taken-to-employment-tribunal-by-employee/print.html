  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>An employee can take you to an employment tribunal over various issues, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay</li>
  <li>dismissal</li>
  <li>discrimination</li>
</ul>
<p>The tribunal is independent and can ask you to pay compensation or reinstate the employee if you lose the case.</p>

<h2>Respond to a claim</h2>

<p>The tribunal will let you know formally if a claim has been made against you.</p>

<p>To respond, fill in and return the form below:</p>

response form' (PDF, 1.4MB)" rel="external">Download ‘Employment tribunal response form’ (PDF, 1.4MB)</a>

</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must respond to the claim within 28 days.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t respond, or are late, the tribunal may make a decision without a hearing.</p>

<h2>Solve the dispute without a hearing</h2>

<p>The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (<abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr>) may contact you when a claim is made. </p>

<p>They’ll offer you ways of solving the problem without a hearing.</p>

<p>You can also call them for advice.</p>

</div>

<h2>Compromise agreements</h2>

<p>You could also sign a compromise agreement. </p>

<p>This offers the employee compensation, who in return drops their claim.</p>

<p>The employee must get legal advice before they sign a compromise agreement. You’ll usually have to pay all the legal fees.</p>

<h2>Get help or legal advice</h2>

<p>You may want to get <a rel="external" href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/" title="legal advice">legal advice</a> if a claim is made against you.</p>

<p>For general guidance on how the process works, call the employment tribunal enquiry line. They <strong>can’t</strong> give legal advice.</p>

<h2>If you’re in Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>Your case will be dealt with by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.employmenttribunalsni.co.uk/" title="Office of Industrial Tribunals and the Fair Employment Tribunal.">Office of Industrial Tribunals and the Fair Employment Tribunal.</a></p>


</article><article id="before-the-hearing"><header><h1>Part 2: Before the hearing</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll be given a date for your hearing at least 14 days in advance. You’ll have to prepare documents and witnesses.</p>

<h2>Preliminary hearings</h2>

<p>Sometimes there will be a preliminary hearing to decide how the case will be handled, eg if more evidence is needed.</p>

<p>The tribunal will let you know:</p>

<ul>
<li>what will be discussed</li>
  <li>if you’ll have to give evidence or provide any extra information</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arranging documents</h2>

<p>You must give the employee 7 days’ notice of any documents that you’ll be relying on as part of your case.</p>

<p>You should bring 6 copies of each document, unless told otherwise.</p>

<p>If the employee is part of a pension scheme, you must bring full details of the scheme to the tribunal.</p>

<p>If the employee is asking to be reinstated, you must say whether this is possible, and if not, the reasons why.</p>

<h2>Organising witnesses</h2>

<p>You must only bring witnesses to the hearing if they can give evidence directly relevant to your case. </p>

<p>If you call a witness and they don’t want to attend, you can ask the tribunal to order them to come. You must apply in writing, in plenty of time, giving:</p>

<ul>
<li>the name and address of the witness</li>
  <li>what the witness will say and how it will help your case</li>
  <li>why the witness has refused to come to the hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>You are usually responsible for paying the witness’s costs.</p>

</div>

<h2>Time off</h2>

<p>The employee, if still employed by you, is entitled to full paid leave to attend the hearing.</p>

<p>They can also ask a colleague to go with them. This colleague is also entitled to full paid leave.</p>


</article><article id="at-the-hearing"><header><h1>Part 3: At the hearing</h1>
  </header><p>The full hearing will decide:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether the employee wins or loses their case</li>
  <li>if they win, what ‘remedy’ (eg compensation, getting their job back) they will get</li>
</ul>
<p>Bring all relevant documents and evidence to the hearing.</p>

<h2>What happens at the hearing</h2>

<p>You (or your representative) and the employee put your case to a panel or a judge, and answer questions.</p>

<p>You can give evidence by reading a statement, if you want to.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You normally get the tribunal’s decision - or ‘judgment’ - on the day, but it may be sent in the post a few days after the hearing.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you win the case</h2>

<p>In most cases, you aren’t awarded any compensation if the employee loses their case. In some cases, however, you may be awarded costs by the tribunal.</p>

<h2>Expenses</h2>

<p>You can’t claim for expenses for going to the tribunal.</p>


</article><article id="lose-the-case"><header><h1>Part 4: If you lose the case</h1>
  </header><p>If you lose your case the tribunal can order you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay compensation</li>
  <li>give the employee their job back, if appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p>If it isn’t appropriate or possible to reinstate the employee, you will pay compensation instead.</p>

<h2>Paying compensation</h2>

<p>Paying compensation is the most common outcome of a tribunal. There are usually limits to the amount of money a tribunal can award.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You have 42 days to pay the compensation.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t pay, you can be forced to do so - this includes being taken to court. You will also start to pay interest on the amount owed. </p>

<p>The tribunal works out the amount using a formula based on the employee’s age, salary and length of service.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There is no compensation limit in cases of discrimination.</p>
</div>

<h2>Paying back state benefits</h2>

<p>Sometimes you will have to pay back any Jobseeker’s Allowance or Income Support that the employee claimed while taking their case to the tribunal.</p>

<p>This is to prevent the employee from getting paid twice.</p>

<p>If this applies to you, the tribunal, then Jobcentre Plus will tell you what you need to do and how much to pay.</p>


</article><article id="if-you-disagree-with-a-tribunal-decision"><header><h1>Part 5: If you disagree with a tribunal decision</h1>
  </header><p>You may be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask the tribunal to look at the case again</li>
  <li>appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask the tribunal to review the decision</h2>

<p>Write to the tribunal within 14 days, saying why you want the decision to be reviewed. You must have a good reason, eg new evidence has turned up.</p>

<p>Send your letter to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/hmcts/tribunals/employment" title="tribunal office">tribunal office.</a></p>

<h2>Appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal</h2>

<p>You can also appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal if you think the employment tribunal made a legal mistake.</p>

<p>Seek <a rel="external" href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/" title="legal advice">legal advice</a> if you’re unsure about this.</p>

<p>Ask the employment tribunal to send you the reasons for the decision, if you don’t already have them.</p>

<p>To appeal, fill in the form below:</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/global/forms/tribunals/emp-appeals/Form1NoticeOfAppeal.pdf" title="Download 'Notice of appeal form' (PDF, 80KB)">Download ‘Notice of appeal form’ (PDF, 80KB)</a></p>
</div>

<p>Send it, with supporting documents, to the appeal tribunal office by email, fax or post.</p>

<h2>Deadline for appealing</h2>

<p>You must appeal within 42 days of the date:</p>

<ul>
