<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Environment Regulations team is responsible for a number of so-called ‘extended producer responsibility’ regulations that derive from European legislation. These regulations ensure that producers of specific categories of products and equipment take full responsibility for the finance treatment, recycling and reprocessing of these items when they reach end of life and is consistent with requirements agreed in Europe. We also deal with legislation that is intended to encourage the eco-design of certain products. </p>

<p>Additionally the team work with the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) to ensure that the interests of business are taken into account in development of wider waste and recycling policy and on the natural environment in areas such as air and water quality. </p>

<p>For more information email: <a href="mailto:env.regs@bis.gsi.gov.uk">env.regs@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="review-of-uks-producer-responsibility-regulations">Review of UK’s Producer Responsibility Regulations</h3>

<p>The UK’s Producer Responsibility Regulations deliver the legislative framework for meeting our <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> obligations to recover and recycle a proportion of the waste batteries, packaging, electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="Electrical and Electronic Equipment">EEE</abbr>) and vehicles placed on the UK market. These Regulations deliver important environmental savings helping the UK to become more resource efficient and reducing its carbon impact. However, government believes that the way in which these Regulations work could be improved in order to optimise their effectiveness and reduce the administrative burdens they place on business. </p>

<p>As part of the government’s commitment to improving regulation, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>) are currently reviewing all Producer Responsibility Regulations. Over the course of the next few months both departments will be listening to ideas from stakeholders on how these could be improved and considering ideas for ensuring greater coherence between them. Formal consultations will take place later in the year. </p>

<p>For further information or to submit comments on the review, please contact <a href="mailto:packaging@defra.gsi.gov.uk"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr></a> or <a href="mailto:env.regs@bis.gsi.gov.uk"><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr></a>. Progress updates will also be posted online at the <a rel="external" href="http://npwd.environment-agency.gov.uk/">Environment Agency</a> in due course. </p>

<h2 id="batteries-and-accumulators--collection-and-recycling">Batteries and Accumulators – collection and recycling</h2>

<p>The Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries and Accumulators Directive (2006/66/EC) aims to improve the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators and minimise the impact that waste batteries and accumulators have on the environment. The Directive places requirements on the design of all new batteries, and requires the separate collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators, reducing the disposal of batteries and accumulators in the municipal waste stream.</p>

<h3 id="key-requirements-of-the-directive">Key requirements of the Directive</h3>

<p>The Directive calls for:</p>

<ul>
<li>restrictions on the use of cadmium and mercury in the design and manufacture of new batteries (subject to exemption and review) </li>
  <li>labelling requirements – all new batteries to be marked with a crossed out wheeled bin symbol and the appropriate chemical symbol where applicable and selected types of battery are also required to have a capacity label</li>
  <li>registration of all ‘producers’ eg manufacturers or importers of batteries</li>
  <li>collection targets for waste portable batteries of 25% of average annual sales in the UK by 2012, rising to 45% in 2016 </li>
  <li>a ban on the disposal of untreated automotive and industrial batteries </li>
  <li>a requirement for producers or third parties acting on their behalf to arrange for the collection and recycling of waste industrial and automotive batteries</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> is the lead UK government department for the Batteries Directive. Specifically, <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> leads on the internal market (or design) provisions of the Directive, and the environmental provisions of the Directive with respect to waste industrial and automotive batteries. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> leads on policy relating to the waste provisions of the Directive with regards to waste portable batteries. There are two sets of UK regulations: the 2008 Regulations deal with internal market aspects, whilst the 2009 Regulations address waste battery collection and recycling issues. </p>

<h3 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h3>

<p>The UK Batteries Regulations place legal obligations on: </p>

<ul>
<li>producers of batteries and products that contain batteries </li>
  <li>distributors (retailers) of batteries </li>
  <li>facilities that treat and/or export waste batteries, including products that contain waste batteries </li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements apply to all businesses irrespective of size. However, there are some differences in obligations, depending upon the quantity and type of batteries that a business puts on the market or distributes. The regulations also have some impact upon consumers and local authorities (when they deal with waste batteries). </p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>/<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> have produced detailed guidance to help you determine whether the regulations affect you and what you should do if you have obligations.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> provides <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-sectors/environmental-and-product-regulations/environmental-regulations/batteries-and-accumulators">further information on policy relating to waste portable batteries, portable batteries compliance schemes and distributor take-back requirements</a>. </p>

<p>The Environment Agency also offers guidance on battery producer registration and associated collection obligations. It also provides guidance for waste battery treatment facilities and exporters.</p>

<p>In addition, further advice to business is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/battery-waste-producer-supplier-responsibilities">Battery waste: producer and supplier responsibilities</a></p>

<h3 id="latest-developments">Latest developments</h3>

<p>Details of the Commission Regulation setting out the rules for capacity labelling of portable secondary and automotive batteries can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/batteries/index.htm">European Commission</a> web site. <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> has published guidance which explains how this fits in with existing requirements.</p>

<h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3>

<p>The Eco-design Directive <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:285:0010:0035:EN:PDF">(2009/125/EC)</a> has been transposed in the UK by the Eco-design for Energy-related Products Regulations 2010 (SI 2010 No.2617). It aims to improve the environmental performance of products throughout the life-cycle, by integration of environmental aspects at a very early stage in product design. The original Directive was recast in 2009 and was previously known as the Energy-Using Products (EuP) Directive 2005/32/EC. This was transposed into UK law under Statutory Instrument (SI 2007 No.2037) which is now revoked.  </p>

<p>A large number of implementing measures are being made under the Directive and apply to individual products or groups of products. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> leads on new regulations resulting from the initial studies which focus on energy efficiency gains. Regulations are enforced by the National Measurement Office (NMO). </p>

<h3 id="latest-information">Latest information</h3>

<p>March 2011 – study examining the functioning and future scope of the Directive launched.

<h4 id="ec-consultation-meetings">EC consultation meetings</h4>

<p>The EC Consultation Forum allows a limited number of stakeholders contribute to the discussions at the European level.  The Commission invited nominations in 2006, from which 30 stakeholders were selected (published on Commission website).  The group also has one representative from each Member State (in the case of the UK, an official from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>). </p>

<h2 id="eco-design-directive--policy-background">Eco-design Directive – policy background</h2>

<h3 id="overview-2">Overview</h3>

<p>The Directive provides an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide framework for improving the environmental performance of energy-related products through eco-design.  It allows for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> wide rules on the environmental performance of these products to be made, preventing national legislation in these areas becoming obstacles to the intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade.  This should benefit both businesses and consumers, by allowing free movement of goods across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and by enhancing product quality and environmental protection.</p>

<p>Not all products will have obligations under the framework Directive, only those meeting criteria with significant environmental impact and volume of trade in the internal market which have clear potential for improvement, for example where market forces fail to make progress in the absence of a legal requirement.</p>

<h3 id="studies-and-development-of-measures">Studies and development of measures</h3>
<p>The European Commission has decided that the first step in considering whether and which eco-design requirements should be set for a particular product is a preparatory study.  This is to recommend ways to improve the environmental performance of the product.</p>

<p>The output from the studies provide the Commission with the necessary information to prepare for the next phases (carried out by the Commission) - the Consultation Forum meetings, and a possible draft implementing measure.  They can take the form of ‘daughter’ Directives, Regulations or Commission Decisions.  Depending on the type of implementing measure proposed, new legislation may be required in the UK although to date measures have been Commission Regulations which do not require transposition. </p>

<p>Links to the studies and the final measures are on the Studies and Regulations Page.</p>

<h3 id="ec-eco-design-consultation-forum">EC Eco-design Consultation Forum</h3>
<p>Article 18 of the Directive provides for the establishing a group of experts called “Consultation Forum” which allows stakeholders to contribute to the implementation of the Directive at the European level.  The tasks of the group of experts is to contribute in particular to the definition and review of working documents, the efficiency of the established market surveillance mechanisms and to the assessment of voluntary agreements and other self-regulatory measures taken in the context of the Directive.  The Forum is also consulted by the Commission during the periodic modification of the Working Plan.</p>

<h3 id="evolution-of-the-directive">Evolution of the Directive</h3>
<p>In 2009, the original 2006 Directive was recast (amended) as the Eco-design Directive (2009/125/EC) to cover a wider range of products, including energy-related products.  These include products which do not consume energy, but which impact on energy consumption, for example, windows, insulation materials or water-using devices such as shower heads or taps, which can reduce water consumption and therefore the amount of energy needed to heat water. </p>

<h2 id="eco-design-of-energy-using-products-eup-directive--regulations-and-studies">Eco-Design of Energy-using products (EuP) Directive – regulations and studies</h2>

<h3 id="regulations-and-studies">Regulations and studies</h3>
<p>In the transition period between the Directive’s entry into force and the first working plan being published, implementing measures were to be introduced for the product groups mentioned in Article 16(2) of the Directive. These have focused on energy efficiency gains. In October 2008 the European Commission published the 2009-2011 Commission Working Plan, indicating the next set of priority product groups.</p>

<p>Product areas and the study website links are given in the table below, along with a guideline status. Once published in final form, a link to the implementing measure is given.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-life-vehicles">End of Life Vehicles</h2>

<h3 id="overview-3">Overview</h3>

<p>The EC ELV Directive (2000/53/EC) aims to reduce the amount of waste from cars and light goods vehicles when they are scrapped. In particular it:</p>

<ul>
<li>includes tightened environmental standards for vehicle treatment sites </li>
  <li>requires that last owners must be able to dispose of their vehicles free of charge </li>
  <li>sets rising reuse, recycling and recovery targets </li>
  <li>restricts the use of hazardous substances in both new vehicles and replacement vehicle parts</li>
</ul>
<p>The UK has transposed the Directive through its ELV Regulations 2003, 2005 and 2010. The 2003 Regulations put in place most of the requirements of the Directive, including the improved standards for vehicle treatment sites (enforced by the relevant environment agency), some new technical standards that apply to new vehicles (enforced by the Vehicle Certification Agency) and the establishment of a Certificate of Destruction (CoD) system (administered by the DVLA). </p>

<p>The remaining provisions of the Directive were the subject of the 2005 Regulations which set out the requirements for vehicle producers to have available networks of facilities where last owners of their brands of vehicles may take them for treatment and recycling at the end of their lives (enforced by <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>). These facilities are required to provide this service free of charge to the last owner (provided vehicles are largely complete and have not had extra waste added). </p>

<p>The two sets of 2010 Regulations make some amendments to the 2003 and 2005 Regulations. </p>

<h3 id="am-i-affected">Am I affected?</h3>

<p>The ELV Regulations place legal obligations on: </p>

<h2 id="fluorinated-greenhouse-gases">Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases</h2>

<h3 id="regulation-ec-no-8422006-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council-on-certain-fluorinated-greenhouse-gases">Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases</h3>

<p>The principle objective of EC Regulation No 842/2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (F gases) (The EC Regulation) is to contain, prevent and thereby reduce emissions of F gases. As well as the EC Regulation, there are ten Commission Regulations which establish fleshed out legal requirements for companies and qualifications for personnel working in five industry sectors covered by the EC Regulation as well as dealing with other requirements relating to leakage checking, reporting and labelling.</p>

<p>The UK has transposed the EC Regulation through its 2009 GB F gas Regulation, which came into force in March 2009.</p>

<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) is the lead Government Department on F gas policy. The Department for Transport (DfT) lead on the use of F gases in mobile air conditioning systems in motor vehicles through the Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) Directive.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="who-is-affected-by-the-ec-f-gas-regulation">Who is affected by the EC F gas Regulation?</h3>

<p>The containment and recovery articles in the EC Regulation impact the commercial refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat pump sectors and the fire protection sector. It also impacts the personnel involved in the installation, servicing and recovery of F gases from these systems, as well as from equipment containing F gas based solvents, high voltage switchgear and fire extinguishers. Operators of relevant systems have a range of obligations including prompt leakage repair, leakage checking and record keeping and ensuring qualified personnel are used.</p>

<p>The EC Regulation will potentially impact a wider range of F gas users other than those set out above due to the recovery obligation in Article 4.3. It will also impact upon producers, importers and exporters of F gases if they produce, import or export more than 1 tonne of F gases per annum as they will have to report to the Commission and Member States’ competent authorities on the amounts produced, imported and exported.</p>

<p>In addition, specified products and equipment that contain F gases will be subject to labelling requirements and specific uses of F gases and products that contain F gases are controlled or banned by the EC Regulation. These cover certain uses of sulphur hexafluoride for magnesium diecasting, use of certain F gases in non-refillable containers, fire protection systems, tyres, one component foams, novelty aerosols, footwear and windows and self chilling cans.</p>

<h4 id="guidance-and-interpretation">Guidance and interpretation:</h4>

<p>The Commission has produced a guidance and interpretation document that provides the view of the Commission Services on various issues of the EC Regulation as a result of discussions with Member States. This should not be considered as a legally binding document. The Commission will update the guidance and interpretation document as new issues arise.</p>

<p>Key obligations in the Regulation have applied in the UK and the rest of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> since 4th July 2007. The Government is continuing to work with stakeholders to ensure that the EC Regulation is successfully implemented and it environmental objectives achieved. Information sheets have been published which provide guidance on compliance with the EC Regulation in relation to individual industry sectors.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> is working closely with BSI, The Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, LACORS (Local Authorities’ Coordinators of Regulatory Services) and the devolved administrations (DAs) to prepare for the implementation of a risk based enforcement approach to the EC Regulation and the 2009 GB Regulations that creates offences and penalties for failure to comply.</p>

<p>F-Gas Support is a Government funded team set up to help organisations understand their obligations under both the EC F gas and Ozone Regulations. They will also be working with councils and national regulators to promote compliance with these important environmental regulations. F-Gas Support is being run on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and the DAs by LACORS and Enviros.</p>

<h4 id="future-work-relating-to-f-gases">Future work relating to F gases:</h4>

<p>There is to be a review of the EC Regulation in 2011 which will include an assessment as to the need for further activity by the European Community and its Member States in light of existing and new international commitments regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-and-packaging-waste-directive--background">Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive – Background</h2>

<p>Background information on the UK Packaging Regulations, the Governmenet’s Advisory Committee on Packaging, and the EC Packaging Directive. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> targets, Commission implementation reports and Article 21 Committee.</p>

<h3 id="uk-background">UK Background</h3>

<p>The Directive has been transposed into UK law by two regulations: </p>

<ul>
<li>The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) </li>
  <li>The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (as amended) </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="packaging-essential-requirements-regulations">Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations</h3>

<p>The regulations set out the requirements that all items of packaging must meet before being placed on the UK market. The essential requirements are, in summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Packing volume and weight must be the minimum amount to maintain necessary levels of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer. </li>
  <li>Noxious or hazardous substances in packaging must be minimised in emissions, ash or leachate from incineration or landfill. </li>
  <li>Packaging must be manufactured so as to permit reuse or recovery in accordance with specific requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regulations are enforced by the Trading Standards on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>.  They can investigate complaints of excessive packaging and can offer guidance on specific packaging products and proving compliance.</p>

<p>Methodological Standards have been developed which can be used to help comply with essential requirements. Full details of the standards are available from <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/Browse-by-Sector/Manufacturing">(BSI) British Standards Institute)</a></p>

<h3 id="producer-responsibility-obligations-packaging-waste-regulations">Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations</h3>

<p>The UK meets the Packaging Directive’s recycling and recovery targets for packaging waste through these regulations, which are based on the principle of the producer responsibility. </p>

<p>Companies above the threshold of a £2million annual turnover and handling more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year pay for a certain proportion of the UK obligations to recycle packaging.</p>

<p>Companies fulfil their obligation by buying Packaging Waste Recovery Notes (PRNs) or Packaging Waste Export Recovery Notes (PERNs).  These have a market value which can fluctuate in relation to demand for the notes in relation to the supply of recycled material; the UK recycling targets set for that year; and the amount of PRNs/PERNs companies or compliance schemes already purchased</p>

<p>Companies can join a compliance scheme to deal with their obligation for them, or directly register with enforcement authorities: the Environment Agency (in England and Wales), Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Scotland) or Environment &amp; Heritage Service (Northern Ireland).  Further information is available on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website. </p>

<h3 id="advisory-committee-on-packaging-acp">Advisory Committee on Packaging (ACP)</h3>

<p>The Government set up the ACP to advise <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> on policy development relating to the Packaging Waste Regulations.  The ACP is chaired by, and composed of industry representatives from across the packaging chain, with enforcement agencies and other government officials taking part.</p>

<p>Details of the ACP, appointments and details of sub-committees and working groups are available on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</p>

<h3 id="eu-background">
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Background</h3>

<p>The Packaging Directive aims of:</p>

<ul>
<li>harmonise national measures so as to prevent or reduce the impacts of packaging on the environment of all Member States and Third Countries and to remove obstacles to trade and distortion and restriction of competition; and </li>
  <li>prevent the production of packaging waste, and reduce the amount of waste for final disposal through packaging re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="european-targets">European targets</h3>

<p>The recover and recycling targets set by the original Directive for packaging waste were revised in 2004 by an amending Directive 2004/12/EC, increasing the recycling tagets to be by Member States by 2008 to 60% overall recovery of packaging waste; 55% minimum to 80% maximumrecycling of packaging waste. The amending Directive also set material specific recycling targets be weight, as follows: glass (60%), paper and board (60%), metals (50%), plastics (22.5%), and wood (15%). The UK achieved these targets at the end of 2008 and in some cases exceeded them, but mustnow at least maintain these levels. </p>

<h3 id="commission-reports-on-implementation-of-the-directive">Commission reports on implementation of the Directive</h3>

<p>In December 2006, the European Commission announced that the recycling and recovery targets contained on the Packaging Directive are currently optimal and proposed these should remain stable to enable all the Member States to catch-up with these targets. </p>

<p>A study by Commission appointed consultants on the implementation of the Directive’s Essential Requirements was published in 2010. </p>

<h3 id="article-21-committee">Article 21 Committee</h3>

<p>The Article 21 Committee is the Directive’s Technical Adaptation Committee (TAC) established by Article 21 of the Packaging Directive. It is chaired by the European Commission and its members are national experts of each Member State. The committee meets once every 12-18 months to discuss issues on harmonisation and implementation of the Directive. </p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> makes public its unofficial notes from these meetings which are distributed via an <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> electronic mailing list.

<p>Background information on the <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directives, scope, implementation, exemptions and exclusions, enforcement, compliance and the Technical Adaptation Committee.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>Directive applies primarily to manufacturers, importers and distributors of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (<abbr title="Electrical and Electronic Equipment">EEE</abbr>), including those who import these goods into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>; those who export these goods to other Member States; and those who re-brand equipment that has been produced by others. </p>

<h3 id="previous-rohs-directive-200295ec">Previous <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive (2002/95/EC)</h3>

<p>The previous <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive (2002) draws its scope from the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>) Directive and applies to categories 1-7 and 10 that are listed under Annex 1A of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive, with the addition of electric light bulbs (lamps) and household luminaires. The 8 categories covered by <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> are: </p>

<p>1.large household appliances </p>

<p>2.small household appliances </p>

<p>3.IT and telecommunications equipment</p>

<p>4.consumer equipment </p>

<p>5.lighting equipment </p>

<p>6.electrical and electronic tools </p>

<p>7.toys, leisure and sports equipment </p>

<p>10.automatic dispensers</p>

<h4 id="categories-8-and-9">Categories 8 and 9</h4>

<p>Two categories within Annex I of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive are currently excluded from the scope of the current <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive. These are category 8 (medical devices) and category 9 (monitoring and control instruments). </p>

<h3 id="current-rohs-directive-201165eu">Current <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive (2011/65/<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The new <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive was published on 1 July 2011. It has its own scope. Initially this will cover the same categories as the 2002 Directive (categories 1-7 and 10). The scope is then expanded through staged increases as follows to introduce categories 8 and 9, as well as a new category 11.</p>

<p>From 22 July 2014, medical devices and monitoring and control instruments into scope.</p>

<p>From 22 July 2016, in vitro medical devices into scope. </p>

<p>From 22 July 2017, industrial monitoring and control instruments into scope.</p>

<p>Until 1 July 2016, reuse of recovered <abbr title="Electrical and Electronic Equipment">EEE</abbr> spare parts in closed loop are exempt.</p>

<p>From 22 July 2019, </p>

<p>i) any product with any electrical function is brought into scope (new category 11).</p>

<p>ii) 2 wheel vehicles which are not type approved enter into scope.</p>

<p>All this is subject to an impact assessment and review due to be carried out by the Commission no later than 22 July 2014 which could recommend changes to scope.</p>

<h3 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h3>

<p>Both the old and new Directive provide for certain exclusions from the scope of <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr>. Detailed information is provided in the Government Guidance Notes and for the new Directive in Article 2.</p>

<h3 id="exemptions">Exemptions</h3>

<h3 id="previous-rohs-directive-200295ec-1">Previous <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive (2002/95/EC)</h3>

<p>Article 5 of the <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive sets out the process for exemptions to be granted on the grounds that the use of alternative substances are either technically or scientifically impracticable. </p>

<p>Exemptions are for specific applications of the restricted substances and once agreed by qualified majority through a vote in the TAC, followed by publication of a Commission Decision in the EC’s official journal, apply to all uses of the substance in that application: there is no requirement to register particular products or those companies taking advantage of the exemption. </p>

<p>The EC has put each batch of exemption requests it receives out to public consultation and then contracted independent technical consultants to make recommendations. Details of those consultations are available from the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs_eee/studies_rohs1_en.htm">Commission’s website</a> </p>

<p>All exemptions agreed can be found by looking at the Annex to the <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive and subsequent Commission Decisions amending the Annex. Copies of both the text of the Directive and the current Decision (consolidating all earlier ones) can be found on the main <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> page. </p>

<h3 id="current-rohs-directive-201165eu-1">Current <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive (2011/65/<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Two list of exemptions are given in the Directive (Annex III and IV). </p>

<p>The new Article 5 sets out the process for exemptions to be granted on the grounds that such inclusion doesn’t weaken the environmental and health protection of Regulation EC 1907/2006, and their elimination or substitution via changes do not require use of items listed in Article 4(1) is scientifically or technically impracticable, the reliability of substitutes is not ensured, and finally, the total negative environmental, health and consumer safety impacts caused by substitution are enough to outweigh the total benefits of these. </p>

<p>Anyone can apply for an exemption, however as they are application rather than company specific, many chose to do so through their trade association on behalf of a sector or group of companies across Europe. You can apply for exemptions under the new Directive, at any time after, the Directive’s into force date, 22 July 2011. </p>

<p>The most recent set of <abbr title="The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations (Statutory Instrument 2008 No. 37) implementing the first directive was laid before the UK Parliament on 11 January 2008 and came into force on 1 February 2008. </p>

<p>These Regulations were updated in 2009, when amending Regulations were laid before Parliament on 11 March and came into force on 6 April 2009. The Regulations were revoked on 2 January 2013 when the new Regulations entered into force. </p>

<h2 id="waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment">Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment</h2>

<p>The UK Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>) Regulations implement the main the provisions of the European <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive. The broad aim is to address the environmental impacts of unwanted electrical and electronic equipment at end of life disposal. </p>

<h3 id="overview-6">Overview</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive is one of a small number of European Directives that implement the principle of “extended producer responsibility”. Under this principle, producers are required to take financial responsibility for the environmental impact of the products that they place on the market, specifically when those products become waste. It seeks to reduce the amount of such waste going to landfill by encouraging separate collection and subsequent treatment, re-use, recovery, recycling and environmentally sound disposal.</p>

<p>The UK Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>) Regulations 2006 (as amended) implement the main provisions of the EC’s <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive. The scope covers a wide range of products intended for household and/or commercial use that are dependent on electrical currents or electromagnetic fields to work properly.</p>

<p>The obligations placed on producers of equipment and waste treatment facilities are enforced in England and Wales by the Environment Agency for England and Wales (EA), in Scotland by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/producer_responsibility/weee.aspx">Scottish Environmental Protection Agency</a> (SEPA) and in Northern Ireland by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ni-environment.gov.uk/waste-home/regulation/regulations_weee.htm">Northern Ireland Environment Agency</a> (NIEA).</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.vca.gov.uk/enforcement/weee-enforcement.asp">The VCA</a> enforces the obligations placed on distributors and the requirement placed on producers to mark their equipment with the “crossed out wheeled bin” symbol.</p>

<h3 id="am-i-affected-2">Am I Affected</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations place legal obligations on the following types of organisations that handle electrical equipment: </p>

<ul>
<li>Producers of household and non-household equipment (ie, manufacturers, professional importers or re-branders) </li>
  <li>Distributors to household-end users (eg retailers, internet and other distance sellers) </li>
  <li>Business end-users of electrical equipment </li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> treatment facilities </li>
  <li>Exporters of <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> </li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements apply to all businesses irrespective of size. There are no exemptions for small and medium sized companies. In addition the Regulations also impact on local authorities, waste management companies and household consumers of electrical and electronic equipment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> has produced detailed <a rel="external" href="http://www.netregs.gov.uk/netregs/topics/WEEE/default.aspx">guidance</a> to help you determine whether the Regulations impact on you and where necessary what you must do to meet your legal obligations. The <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32084.aspx">Environment Agency</a> also offers detailed guidance to producers and treatment facilities and VCA provides advice to distributors.</p>

<h3 id="advice-to-consumers">Advice to consumers</h3>

<p>All retailers of electrical equipment must support recycling many provide funding for local authority collection facilities, others take back waste electrical equipment in their stores.</p>

<p>There are two easy ways to avoid house clutter and get rid of old electricals without throwing them in the bin:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.recyclenow.com/why_recycling_matters/electricals/">your local recycling centre</a> - All local authorities across the UK now have dedicated facilities for collecting waste electrical goods.</li>
  <li>Some retailers will take back your old electrical item in store, when you purchase a new item from them (but note that not all shops do this). </li>
</ul>

<p>The report <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/w/12-1007-waste-electrical-and-electronic-weee-regulations-individual-producer-ipr-responsibility.pdf">Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations: Individual Producer Responsibility in the UK Context</a>  was published on 09 August 2012. The report, produced independently by a <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> Working Group of external stakeholders sets out recommendations on how individual producer responsibility could be introduced to the UK. </p>

<p>The outcome of the Environmental Theme of the Red Tape Challenge was published in March 2012. It includes a commitment by <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> to address concerns expressed by producers of electrical equipment about the existing <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations and in particular the cost of compliance. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-call-for-evidence?cat=open">A Call for Evidence</a> was published on 29 May 2012 seeking input from key stakeholder groups intended to inform proposals for change. </p>

<p>[Revisions to the existing <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive] have been agreed in Europe and will be published later this year by the European Commission following completion of internal processes. </p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> has been working with industry to establish PAS 141 - a new process management specification for the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment. It is to be launched shortly and aims to encourage the reuse of <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> as promoted by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive; reduce the amount of <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> sent to landfill and assure consumers that used equipment has been tested, is prepared and safe to use, is functional, free of protected data and backed by a warranty. Copies of PAS 141 can be purchased from BSI. </p>

<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Latest Developments</h2>

<p>This page is intended to provide up to date information on current policy developments in Europe and the UK that are likely to impact on companies and organisations that have an interest in the UK Regulations on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment.</p>

<h3 id="revised-weee-directive--next-steps">Revised <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive – Next Steps</h3>

<p>The original <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive was published at the beginning of 2003 and obliged the European Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and European Council within five years, along with proposals for revisions to the original Directive. </p>

<p>The Commission published <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm">proposals</a> for a “recast” of the Directive in December 2008. Negotiations were concluded in December 2011. The European Parliament voted in support of the revised Directive in January and European Council is expected to adopt the text of the revised Directive shortly. <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> will consult later this year or early next on necessary amendments to the UK <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. We will use that opportunity to consider other improvements we should make to the UK <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> system that are good for business whilst ensuring environmental objectives are achieved.</p>

<h3 id="improving-the-uk-weee-regulations">Improving the UK <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations</h3>

<p>The Red Tape Challenge was launched by the Prime Minister on 7 April 2011. It gives business and the public the chance to have their say on some of the more than 10,000 regulations that affect their everyday lives.</p>

<p>The outcome of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/03/19/red-tape-challenge/">Environmental Theme of the Red Tape Challenge</a> was announced on 19 March 2012.</p>

<p>Electrical producers told us the amount they have to pay for the collection, treatment, recovery and recycling of their market share of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>) through producer compliance schemes is often much higher than the true costs of processing <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-call-for-evidence?cat=open">A Call for Evidence</a> was published on 29 May 2012 seeking input from key stakeholder groups intended to inform proposals for change. </p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> will introduce regulatory changes to address these concerns by 2014. One option is giving producers a fixed minimum tonnage to finance, based on their market share. Another is a new central allocation system for local authority sites to help the schemes fully align collections with their members’ obligations. Options for change will form part of the proposed consultation necessary as part of the process for introducing the requirements of the revised <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Directive in the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> will work with industry in the short term to find an interim solution. One option is to calculate obligations based on the data from a previous compliance period to reduce uncertainty and help producers pay a more accurate amount. </p>

<p>Separately, an industry led Working Group established by <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> has submitted its <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/w/12-1007-waste-electrical-and-electronic-weee-regulations-individual-producer-ipr-responsibility.pdf">report to government on the issue of Individual Producer Responsibility</a>  and the extent to which it could be introduced into the UK at a practical level.</p>
