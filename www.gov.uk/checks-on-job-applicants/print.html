    <section role="main"><header><h1>Checks on job applicants, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Employers must check that job applicants are <a href="/check-an-employees-right-to-work-documents" title="Check an employee's right to work documents">allowed to work in the UK</a> before they hire them. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>An employer can be fined up to £10,000 if they can’t show evidence that they checked an employee’s right to work in the UK.</p>
</div>

<p>An employer might also need to carry out checks on someone’s qualifications, health or criminal record.</p>

<h2>Data protection</h2>

<p>Employers must follow <a href="/data-protection-your-business/recruitment-managing-staff-records" title="Data protection and your business (recruitment and managing staff records)">data protection rules</a> for information on job applicants.</p>

</article><article id="criminal-records-checks"><header><h1>Part 2: Criminal records checks</h1>
  </header><p>The process for criminal records checks depends on what country you’re in.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Employers must tell applicants that they’re going to carry out a criminal records check, and explain why it’s necessary.</p>
</div>

<h2>England and Wales</h2>
<p>If a new member of staff will be working with children or vulnerable adults, the employer must get a standard or enhanced <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check" title="Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks">Criminal Records Bureau (<abbr title="Criminal Records Check">CRB</abbr>)</a> check for them before they can start work. </p>

<p>Find out what <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check" title="Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks">types of checks</a> there are and <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check/arranging-crb-checks-as-an-employer" title="Arranging CRB checks as an employer">how an employer can apply.</a></p>

<p>Employers must not apply for a check unless the job needs one - read <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/CRB/about-the-crb/eligible-positions-guide" title="CRB checks: eligible positions guidance">‘<abbr title="Criminal Records Check">CRB</abbr> checks: eligible positions guidance’</a> from the Home Office.</p>

<h3>Basic checks</h3>

<p>If the job doesn’t need a standard or enhanced check, employers can still <a rel="external" href="http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/apply-online/" title="Apply online for Basic Disclosure from Disclosure Scotland">get a basic check from Disclosure Scotland</a> (even if you’re in England or Wales). This check reveals if someone has any unspent criminal convictions.</p>

<h3>Employing ex-offenders</h3>

<p>If employers carry out criminal record checks, they must have a policy on employing ex-offenders and show it to any applicant who asks for it. </p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/CRB/about-the-crb/sample-policy-rec-exoffend?view=Binary" title="Download 'Sample policy statement on the recruitment of ex-offenders' (PDF, 53KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Sample policy on the recruitment of ex-offenders’ (PDF, 53KB).</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Scotland</h2>
<p>Get a criminal records check in Scotland from <a rel="external" href="http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/apply/employers/" title="Apply for a disclosure">Disclosure Scotland.</a></p>

<h2>Northern Ireland</h2>
<p>Get a criminal records check in Northern Ireland from <a rel="external" href="http://www.dojni.gov.uk/accessni" title="Access Northern Ireland">AccessNI.</a></p>

<h2>Overseas applicants</h2>

<p>Employers must get a criminal records check if the job needs one. If the worker is from another country, disclosure organisations in the UK probably won’t have any information on them. Employers can <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/foreign-embassies-in-uk/" title="Find a foreign embassy in the UK">contact their country’s embassy</a> to see if they can get a similar check done in the applicant’s country.</p>


</article><article id="health-checks"><header><h1>Part 3: Health checks</h1>
  </header><p>Employers can ask for a health check before hiring someone if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s a legal requirement - eg eye tests for commercial vehicle drivers</li>
  <li>it’s not a legal requirement but there is a good reason - eg because their insurers need health checks on cycle couriers</li>
</ul>
<p>Only successful candidates should be asked to have health checks, and employers should include information about these checks in their offer letter.</p>

<p>Employers must have written consent from the candidate before asking for a medical report from their doctor. Candidates have the right to see the report and can ask for it to be changed or withheld from the employer. </p>

<h3>Avoiding discrimination</h3>
<p>Employers must make sure their checks don’t:</p>

<ul>
<li>discriminate - eg by doing a health check that discriminates against <a href="/recruitment-disabled-people/" title="Recruitment and disabled people">disabled people</a> and isn’t necessary for the job</li>
  <li>discourage people from applying for the job</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>An employer who discriminates against a candidate because of a disability that doesn’t stop them from doing the job can be prosecuted.</p>
</div>
