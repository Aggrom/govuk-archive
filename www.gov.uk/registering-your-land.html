<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are two types of land registers - the Rural Land Register (<abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>) and Land Registry. Land Registry is a governmental department that records all land and property ownership, boundaries between different owners and legalities if there is a change to ownership, including records of sales and mortgages of registered land. It guarantees titles to registered estates and interests in land. It also oversees the Home Information Packs, early completions and training resources and qualifications.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> is managed by the Rural Payments Agency and is not connected to Land Registry.  It only registers land that is farmed or has some environmental value that is relevant to land-based subsidy schemes. The <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> also has different rules about what constitutes a boundary. You can use an authorised agricultural agent or intermediary to register your land on your behalf.</p>

<p>This guide discusses the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> and Land Registry, and why you or your agent should register your land with each. It also deals with various environmental and farming payment schemes, such as the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="land-registry">Land Registry</h2>

<p>Officially known under the Land Registration Act 2002 as Her Majesty’s Land Registry, Land Registry was established in 1862. Land Registry is responsible for publicly recording interests in registered land in England and Wales and reports to the Ministry of Justice. It is now an executive agency.</p>

<p>Registering your land with Land Registry has a number of benefits, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>only having to register your land with Land Registry once, and voluntary registration - cost varies according to scale (eg £30 for land worth up to £50,000 and £525 for land worth over £1 million) and you will receive a 25 per cent discount if you are a first-time registrant</li>
  <li>all of your land and property being registered together with Land Registry - it will stay in one central place</li>
  <li>dealing with the legality and rights of the land and providing you with a state guarantee of ownership - this guarantee does not apply to tenant farmers</li>
  <li>protecting your land from encroachment</li>
  <li>helping you to identify all of your landholdings, simplify your title(s) and computerise your records - so management is easier</li>
  <li>providing easy access to landowner details when selling your land or if someone should make a claim on the property</li>
</ul>
<p>Most buyers will expect land to be registered with Land Registry before purchasing.</p>

<p>If you or your agent has lost your ownership deeds or has difficulties proving your title, you may still be able to register your land.</p>

<p>Registering your land with Land Registry can give you greater certainty and security about what you own, particularly in the event of land disputes. Once you register your land, you have the title to it guaranteed by the state, making buying and selling easier.</p>

<h2 id="the-rural-land-register">The Rural Land Register</h2>

<p>The Rural Land Register (<abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>) is run by the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>), and is a database of digital maps that show agricultural, woodland and marginal land on which subsidy payments are based. It also records freehold and leasehold properties where the lease has been approved for a term of over seven years. The <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> collects different information about the land from Land Registry and the method by which the maps are produced is also different from Land Registry. The <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> also measures land boundaries.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> was developed to modernise and simplify land-based schemes. It also meets <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations that require the use of an electronic geographic information system.</p>

<p>If your land is already registered with Land Registry, you or your agent still needs to register it with the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>. You only need to register the land that you carry out agricultural activities on with the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. Therefore, if you want to claim for the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, Environmental Stewardship schemes, or the English Woodland Grant Scheme (<abbr title="English Woodland Grant Scheme">EWGS</abbr>) (from 1 April 2008 only), you need to register your land with the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>. This needs to be done whenever anything changes with your existing registered land.</p>

<p>If you are a landlord with a tenant or grazier, the land can only be registered once on the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>. However, under some circumstances it is possible for two people to claim under two different schemes on te same area of land.</p>

<h2 id="payment-schemes-and-the-rural-land-register">Payment schemes and the Rural Land Register</h2>

<p>You or your agent must register your land on the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> in order to qualify for most payment schemes.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you register your land before applying for the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>. However, you can still submit your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> claim as long as you submit a map with your claim form. <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> maps are usually produced on a scale of 1:5,000 and are printed on A3 paper in colour. Each of your fields should appear in their entirety on a map.</p>

<p>If you don’t know the size of your land, you or your agent can submit an RLE1 form before your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> claim. This will enable you to put the correct land size on your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> claim form and to be paid the correct amount. </p>

<p>You can also see the guide on the SPS.</p>

<p>Only land that is recorded on the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> can be entered into any of the three Environmental Stewardship schemes. For more information, see the guide on Environmental Stewardship: the basics.</p>

<p>All land must be registered with the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> in order to qualify for the <abbr title="English Woodland Grant Scheme">EWGS</abbr>. For more information, see the guides on trees and woodland and on the Farm Environment Plan (FEP).</p>

<h2 id="rural-payments-agency-how-to-register-your-land">Rural Payments Agency: how to register your land</h2>

<p>In order to qualify for the various subsidy payment schemes, you will need to register your land with the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> whenever anything changes with your existing registered land. An authorised agent can also register your land on your behalf.</p>

<p>To register your land with the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>, you or your agent should contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on 0845 603 7777. Alternatively you can print the form from the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rle1"><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website</a>.  You will need your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) when you call. The <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> is the number that identifies your ‘business’ and is provided by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. If you don’t already have an <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>, you should contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> to obtain one.</p>

<p>You or your agent will be asked specific questions about your land. These will be transferred to an RLE1 application form and sent to you or your agent - who can submit the form on your behalf. If you are unable to answer any of the questions, you or your agent can call the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 603 7777.</p>

<p>The first time your land is registered, the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you a complete set of coloured A3 maps. After that, you will receive new maps for any additional land you register or updated maps for any land parcels that have changed.</p>

<h2 id="rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-form">Rural Land and Entitlements (RLE1) form</h2>

<p>The RLE1 form is used to notify the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> of entitlement or land transfers. It also allows you or your agent to register new land or make permanent boundary changes to your existing registered land.</p>

<p>For example, if you are intending to apply to the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, you will first have to register your land on the <abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>. To do this, you or your agent needs to request form RLE1 by calling the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Customer Service Centre on Tel 0845 603 7777.  Alternatively you can print the form from the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rle1"><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website</a>.  </p>

<p>If an agent is authorised by means of an agent/partnership authorisation form (SP9) or customer registration form (CReg01), they can submit a form on your behalf. Your transfer request may be rejected if your RLE1 form is signed by an agent who is not authorised to submit scheme documents on your behalf. If the agent is not already authorised, you will need to complete and send an SP9 with the RLE1.</p>

<p>To register your land, you or your agent should contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 603 7777. You will need your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> when you call. You’ll be asked specific questions about your land.</p>

<p>If you’re transferring entitlements or land, you will need the following information when you make your call:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> of the farmer transferring entitlements out of their business</li>
  <li>the number of land parcels being transferred</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> of the farmer transferring entitlements into their business</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Personal Identifier (<abbr title="Personal Identifier">PI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> is for your business as a whole and the <abbr title="Personal Identifier">PI</abbr> is a personal number for you. For example, if there is more than one person running the farm, then each of you will have a <abbr title="Personal Identifier">PI</abbr> number that you will need to provide when you ring up.</p>

<p>When you receive your RLE1, it will most likely be pre-populated with the details you provided during your phone call. If you need help, you can call the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 603 7777.</p>

<h2 id="registering-your-land-additional-resources">Registering your land: additional resources</h2>
