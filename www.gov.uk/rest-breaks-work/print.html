  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="types-of-break"><header><h1>Part 1: Types of break</h1>
  </header><p>Workers are usually legally entitled to rest breaks if they work for someone else, but their rights depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>their age</li>
  <li>how many hours they work per day</li>
  <li>the kind of work they do </li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="/rest-breaks-work/exceptions" title="Exceptions to the rules">exceptions</a> to the rights to rest breaks. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A worker’s employment contract may say that they’re entitled to more or different rights to breaks from work.</p>
</div>

<h2>Adult workers</h2>
<p>Workers over 18 are usually entitled to 3 types of rest breaks.</p>

<h3>‘Rest breaks at work’</h3>
<p>If they work more than 6 hours a day, they have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day (this could be a tea or lunch break). </p>

<h3>‘Daily rest’</h3>
<p>Workers have the right to 11 hours rest between working days (eg if they finish work at 8pm, they shouldn’t start work again until 7am the next day).</p>

<h3>‘Weekly rest’</h3>
<p>Workers have the right to an uninterrupted 24 hours without any work each week or 48 hours each fortnight.</p>

<h2>Work that puts health and safety at risk</h2>
<p>If a person’s work is ‘monotonous’ (eg like working on a production line), an employer should give them enough breaks to make sure their health and safety isn’t at risk.</p>

<p>Domestic workers in a private house (eg a cleaner or au pair) aren’t entitled to rest breaks for health and safety reasons.</p>

<h2>Young workers</h2>
<p>Young workers (above <a href="/know-when-you-can-leave-school" title="School leaving age">school leaving age</a> and under 18) are usually entitled to:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 30 minute rest break if they work more than 4.5 hours (if possible this should be one continuous break)</li>
  <li>daily rest of 12 hours</li>
  <li>weekly rest of 48 hours</li>
</ul></article><article id="rules-for-taking-breaks"><header><h1>Part 2: Rules for taking breaks</h1>
  </header><p>Employers can say when workers take their rest break during work time as long as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the break is taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day (not at the beginning or end) </li>
  <li>the worker is allowed to spend it away from their desk or workstation (ie away from where they actually work) </li>
</ul>
<p>If an employer says a worker should go back to work before their break is finished, it doesn’t count as a rest break.</p>

<p>Unless their employment contract says so, workers don’t have the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li>take smoking breaks</li>
  <li>get paid for their rest breaks</li>
</ul></article><article id="exceptions"><header><h1>Part 3: Exceptions</h1>
  </header><p>Workers aren’t entitled to the 3 types of rest breaks if they work in: </p>

<ul>
<li>the armed forces, emergency services or police and they’re dealing with an exceptional catastrophe or disaster</li>
  <li>a job where they freely choose what hours they work (like a managing director) or where the work is not measured (ie no set hours)</li>
  <li>sea transport</li>
  <li>air or road transport (known as ‘mobile’ workers) </li>
</ul>
<p>Air, sea or road transport workers may be covered by special rules that give them different rest rights. </p>

<p>Mobile workers not covered by any special rules will usually have the right to regular rest so that their health and safety (or anyone else’s) isn’t put at risk.</p>

<h2>Different rules for rest breaks</h2>
<p>Depending on circumstances at work or the type of job a person does, they may only have the right to take rest later (eg during the same or following day). </p>

<p>This is known as ‘compensatory rest’ which is the same length of time as the break (or part of it) that they’ve missed. </p>

<p>A worker may be entitled to compensatory rest if:</p>

<ul>
<li>their workplace is a long way from their home (eg an oil rig) </li>
  <li>they work in different places which are a reasonable distance from each other </li>
  <li>they’re doing security and surveillance-based work </li>
  <li>they’re working in an industry which is very busy at certain times of the year – like agriculture, retail, postal services or tourism </li>
  <li>they need to work because there’s an exceptional event, an accident or a risk that an accident is about to happen </li>
  <li>the job needs round-the-clock staffing so there aren’t interruptions to any services or production (eg hospital work)</li>
  <li>they work in the rail industry on board trains or their job is linked to making sure trains run on time</li>
  <li>they’re a shift worker and they can’t take daily or weekly rest breaks between ending one shift and starting another</li>
  <li>their working day is split up (eg they’re a cleaner and work for part of the morning and the evening)</li>
  <li>there is an agreement between management, trade unions or the workforce (a ‘collective’ or ‘workforce’ agreement) that has changed or removed rights to these rest breaks for a group of workers</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The total rest entitlement for a week is 90 hours a week on average -  this doesn’t include breaks at work, which are additional.</p>
</div>

<h2>Exceptions for young workers</h2>
<p>Young workers sometimes aren’t entitled to daily rest or rest breaks at work if their work has to be done because of an exceptional event (eg an accident). This is only where:</p>

<ul>
<li>there isn’t a worker over 18 who can do the work</li>
  <li>the work is temporary and must be done immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>If a young worker isn’t entitled to daily rest or rest breaks at work, they have the right to compensatory rest. This is the same amount of rest that they should have had. It can be taken just  after any rest they’ve missed but it must be taken within the following  3 weeks. </p>

</article><article id="disputes-about-breaks"><header><h1>Part 4: Disputes about breaks</h1>
  </header><p>Workers who can’t take or aren’t allowed rest breaks should speak to their manager informally. </p>
