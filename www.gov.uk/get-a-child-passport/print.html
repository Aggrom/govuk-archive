</ul>
<p>You automatically have parental responsibility if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>are the child’s mother</li>
  <li>are the child’s father and are married to the child’s mother</li>
  <li>were married to the child’s mother when the child was born (or, in Scotland, when the mother became pregnant)</li>
  <li>have adopted the child (alone, or jointly)</li>
</ul>
