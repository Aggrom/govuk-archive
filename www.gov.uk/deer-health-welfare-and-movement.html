<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>All keepers have a duty of care under the Animal Welfare Act to ensure the welfare of their animals.</p>

<p>This guide deals specifically with health and welfare considerations for farming deer. It offers advice on handling, suitable accommodation, stocking rates and humane slaughter. It also outlines your responsibilities concerning regular inspections, disease control and diet. This guide does not apply to the management of wild deer.</p>

<h2 id="good-practice-and-duty-of-care-for-deer">Good practice and duty of care for deer</h2>

<p>If you farm deer, and are involved in the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>), which requires that you meet all relevant cross compliance requirements, then all Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>) relevant to general animal health and welfare will apply to you. These include feed and food law (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 11), animal disease (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 13 and 15) and animal welfare (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 18).</p>

<p>Good agricultural and environmental condition 9 is particularly relevant to deer farming and concerns overgrazing and supplementary feeding. You must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>allow your livestock to overgraze the natural or semi-natural vegetation. Overgrazing occurs when the new growth, quality or diversity of self-seeded or self-propagated vegetation is adversely affected.</li>
  <li>carry out unsuitable supplementary feeding - unless vital to ensure animal welfare during periods of extreme weather. Supplementary feeding is considered unsuitable when trampling and churning of the ground by the animals or the vehicles used to transport the feed is detrimental to the natural vegetation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is essential that you maintain high standards for animal health and welfare on your farm for efficient production, managing the risk of disease and ensuring consumer confidence in your produce.</p>

<h3 id="animal-welfare-rights">Animal welfare rights</h3>

<p>The Farm Animal Welfare Council (<abbr title="Farm Animal Welfare Council">FAWC</abbr>) - a government advisory body - has established five freedoms for animal welfare. These state that - at all times - your animals should have freedom:</p>

<ul>
<li>from hunger and thirst - animals must have access to fresh water and a diet which will maintain health and vigour</li>
  <li>from discomfort - an appropriate environment should be provided, including shelter and a comfortable resting area</li>
  <li>from pain, injury or disease - you must ensure the prevention of illnesses, or rapid diagnosis and treatment</li>
  <li>to express normal behaviour - sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal’s own kind should all be provided</li>
  <li>from fear and distress - you must provide conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.fawc.org.uk/freedoms.htm">read about the five freedoms of animal welfare on the <abbr title="Farm Animal Welfare Council">FAWC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>It is essential that you maintain high standards for animal health and welfare on your farm for efficient production, managing the risk of disease and ensuring consumer confidence in your produce.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/act/index.htm">find guidance on how the Animal Welfare Act 2006 affects you on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<p>The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 and the Mutilations Regulations 2007 (as amended) - are other laws that apply to deer keeping. You can <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=12757&amp;id=12758">find the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> code of recommendations for ensuring the welfare of farmed deer on the Agricultural Document Library (AdLib) website.</a></p>

<p>The following procedures are permitted in deer at any age:</p>

<ul>
<li>for identification purposes, you can use ear clipping, notching or tagging, micro-chipping, tattooing or another method involving a mutilation required by law</li>
  <li>the control of reproduction is permitted by castration, the implantation of a subcutaneous contraceptive or vasectomy</li>
  <li>the removal of the non-sensitive part of antlers that are not in velvet from farmed deer or deer kept on land in the same manner as if they were farmed deer</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the fact that the above procedures are ‘permitted procedures’ does not mean that they can be carried out by people who are not veterinary surgeons, unless that procedure is covered by an exemption.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Farm Animal Welfare Council">FAWC</abbr> - an independent advisory body - produces specific guidance for the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>on farm</li>
  <li>during transport</li>
  <li>at market</li>
  <li>at slaughter</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="welfare-for-deer-on-farms">Welfare for deer on farms</h3>

<p>You must ensure your deer are looked after by a sufficient number of staff who have adequate skills and knowledge. Anyone attending your deer must be familiar with - and have access to - the recommendations outlined in this guide and detailed in full in the ‘deer code’.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=12757&amp;id=12758">read the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> code of recommendations for the welfare of deer on the AdLib website.</a></p>

<h2 id="deer-health-and-disease-prevention">Deer health and disease prevention</h2>

<p>Diseases that affect farm animals can be spread very easily and infection may not always be apparent - particularly in the early stages. You will need to carry out and enforce biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of disease and protect the health of animals and humans.</p>

<p>In particular, when planning which biosecurity measures to take, you should pay close attention to these high-risk areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>movement of animals, people and machinery between and within farms</li>
  <li>farm visitors - people and vehicles</li>
  <li>the introduction of new animals</li>
  <li>contact with neighbouring livestock</li>
  <li>sharing farm equipment</li>
  <li>contamination by vermin and wild birds</li>
  <li>animals drinking from contaminated rivers and streams</li>
</ul>
<p>As routine, you should control and keep to a minimum all movement of people, vehicles and equipment in areas where animals are kept. Vehicles, equipment and protective clothing should also be cleaned and disinfected before and after contact with your animals. Wherever feasible, you should use disposable protective clothing.</p>

<p>However, biosecurity measures do become compulsory if a Restricted Infected Area is declared following the outbreak of a notifiable disease. For more information, <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/documents/biosecurity_guidance.pdf">download biosecurity guidance from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 51KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="newly-bought-deer">Newly bought deer</h3>

<p>Before buying any animals, make sure you know their health status. As a precaution, keep new animals separate from your other livestock when they first arrive on your farm and handle this isolated stock last.</p>

<p>For more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disease-prevention-for-livestock-farmers">routine good hygiene and biosecurity measures</a> and disease prevention</p>

<h3 id="notifiable-diseases">Notifiable diseases</h3>

<p>If you suspect any of your deer have caught one of the notifiable diseases listed below, you must immediately notify your local Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency
(<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) Office - an agency of the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. No animals should be moved until an assessment has been carried out by the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> - who may impose additional restrictions to prevent the disease spreading.</p>

<p>The following are notifiable diseases for deer:</p>

<ul>
<li>foot and mouth disease</li>
  <li>bovine tuberculosis</li>
  <li>bluetongue</li>
  <li>epizootic haemorrhagic virus disease</li>
</ul>
<p>A swift response to any suspected disease outbreak is essential to help prevent it spreading. For more information on notifiable diseases, including those most likely in the UK, how to prevent them and what you should do if you suspect an outbreak, see the guide on disease notification and restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="tuberculosis-tb">Tuberculosis (<abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Bovine <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr> (<abbr title="bovine Tuberculosis">bTB</abbr>) is a chronic, mainly respiratory infectious disease of cattle, which occurs sporadically in deer and is a notifiable disease under the Tuberculosis (Deer) Order 1989. The owner or person in charge of deer or deer carcasses, or a veterinary surgeon or meat inspector who, in the course of their duties, suspect the presence of <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr> in any deer - whether farmed, park or wild - must immediately report it to the local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. Suitable tissue samples can then be submitted to the laboratory for identification of the causative bacterium.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/publications/advice-guidance/bovine-tb.html">find a range of publications on <abbr title="bovine Tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>For the latest news and guidance on bovine tuberculosis (<abbr title="bovine Tuberculosis">bTB</abbr>), <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/a-z/bovine-tb/">read the latest on <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr> in cattle on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Deer must be marked or identified in the appropriate manner, before you are permitted to:</p>

<ul>
<li>move them on to or off any premises</li>
  <li>move any carcasses (other than wild deer)</li>
  <li>test them for <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Live <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing of deer, for whatever reason, is by the tuberculin skin test at the owner’s expense. The test may only be carried out with prior authorisation from - and by Official Veterinarians appointed by - the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> may require testing of any deer at the owner’s expense in order to ascertain the presence of <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr> in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>to screen imported animals</li>
  <li>to remove movement restrictions</li>
  <li>where <abbr title="bovine Tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> is suspected</li>
  <li>under the Deer Health Scheme</li>
</ul>
<p>The Deer Health Scheme is a voluntary scheme that enables deer farmers to get their animals certified as officially free from <abbr title="bovine Tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> by having them voluntarily <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr> tested at annual or two-yearly intervals, depending on the location of the herd. For more information about the scheme, contact the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-deer-from-lead-poisoning-on-farms">Protecting deer from lead poisoning on farms</h2>

<p>Lead poisoning can cost you money and kill your deer. It can also result in stunted animal growth, animal death, birth defects, decreased productivity, loss of market value, disposal costs for dead animals and vet fees.</p>

<p>Actual lead poisoning is diagnosed infrequently in deer, although deer have a similar susceptibility to lead poisoning to other ruminants. This reflects their grazing and browsing activities and their behaviour.</p>

<p>Lead residues in deer carcasses are a major concern. Lead contamination renders meat and offal unsafe and it is illegal to allow it to enter the food chain.</p>

<h3 id="causes-of-lead-poisoning-on-farms">Causes of lead poisoning on farms</h3>

<p>As deer are usually kept free range on pasture behind high fences, exposure to lead is most likely to be due to sources that could occur on pastures, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>ingestion of soils with high lead content - these may arise from historic mining and smelting operations or erosion, especially by water courses or landslips.</li>
  <li>ash from fires in which leaded materials were burned - eg painted wood, lead acid batteries, wiring or vehicles. This is of particularly risk as fireash may be palatable to deer.</li>
  <li>lead shot - eg from shooting - may be taken up by deer during grazing. Lead shot can also contaminate certain crops that deer feed on by physical entrapment - eg maize.</li>
  <li>lead acid batteries that have been fly-tipped onto grazing areas or abandoned on pastures after being used to electrify fencing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="withdrawal-periods-and-offal-removal-following-exposure-to-lead">Withdrawal periods and offal removal following exposure to lead</h3>

<p>A 16-week withdrawal period before slaughter is usually sufficient for deer. However, for lead which is retained in the stomach - such as battery parts or metallic lead - this can remain for several years. Some animals may show no signs of lead poisoning but have lead residues in their offal and meat. However, since deer offal is always removed and discarded, there are no food safety implications. Meat may still need to be tested to investigate whether lead residues are present and also to monitor whether a withdrawal period has been long enough.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-avoid-lead-contamination">How to avoid lead contamination</h3>

<p>There are several steps you can take to protect your deer and the human food chain from lead contamination. You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid keeping your deer on soils with high lead content</li>
  <li>minimise ingestion of soils with moderate lead levels through good pasture management</li>
  <li>avoid keeping your deer on waterlogged land and poaching</li>
  <li>avoid overgrazing and maintain sward heights</li>
  <li>fence off any areas of bare soil</li>
  <li>provide salt licks and mineral supplements for your deer</li>
  <li>provide uncontaminated mains water for your deer and avoid any contact with natural runoff, where possible</li>
  <li>prevent your deer from coming into contact with fireash</li>
  <li>inspect your fields for lead sources - eg lead acid batteries, flaking paint and lead flashing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-do-if-you-suspect-lead-poisoning-in-your-deer">What to do if you suspect lead poisoning in your deer</h3>

<p>If you suspect any of your deer are contaminated with lead, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>remove your deer from the area where contamination has occurred</li>
  <li>consult your vet immediately</li>
  <li>investigate the cause of poisoning or contamination</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-for-lead-in-deer">Testing for lead in deer</h3>

<p>For advice on lead poisoning and to arrange a test for lead in your deer, produce or soil, you can contact your vet or the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Veterinary Laboratories Agency">VLA</abbr>). Call the Laboratory Services Department on Tel 01932 357 335.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/vla/vla/vla_map.htm">find contact details for your regional <abbr title="Veterinary Laboratories Agency">VLA</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="shelter-and-housing-for-deer">Shelter and housing for deer</h2>

<p>Under normal conditions, adult deer do not usually need housing but they do need protection from adverse weather conditions and should have access to a drained lying area. You should make provision for bullied, injured or sick animals to be separated. Ideally, segregated animals should still be able to see their fellow deer to prevent boredom or panic.</p>

<h3 id="housing-and-fencing">Housing and fencing</h3>

<p>You may need to house your deer during the winter - particularly calves and animals on farms prone to severe weather.</p>

<p>Your perimeter fencing needs to be around two metres high to avoid your deer injuring themselves by trying to escape. A suitable mesh should be used - with no dangerous projections - and covered with a material such as hessian to prevent the deer from seeing through.</p>

<p>Partitions between pens are best made from something solid to prevent the spread of disease and to minimise broken bones. You must not use wood covered with toxic paints or wood preservatives - particularly lead-based paint on second-hand wood.</p>

<p>Calving hinds and calves tend to seek solitude in natural cover, such as patches of bracken. Where none is available, you should provide suitable alternative cover before the hind calves, so that it has a chance to get used to its surroundings.</p>

<p>If for any reason your deer are continuously housed, they should be kept in small groups of ten to 15 and balanced for size and weight. Stags in antler that are over three years old must be penned individually.  </p>

<h2 id="feed-and-water-for-deer">Feed and water for deer</h2>

<p>You should ensure each of your deer gets a daily diet adequate for maintaining its well-being - including a good supply of fresh, clean water. It is also important that you provide enough trough space or feeding and water points to avoid competition.</p>

<p>You need to introduce any alterations in diet gradually, as sudden changes may cause digestive problems or even death. Deer lose their appetite significantly during the winter, so you should take special care to ensure they are well fed in the run up.</p>

<p>New-born calves should be left to suckle from their dams before weaning. They can then be artificially reared - using liquid food for the first five to eight weeks. Sheep or goat’s milk - or milk substitute - are suitable for deer but substances formulated for bovines are not. Calves should also have access to a feed compound, clean water and roughage from an early age.  </p>

<h2 id="handling-and-inspection-of-deer">Handling and inspection of deer</h2>

<p>Deer are temperamentally different to other farm animals - being highly strung and nervous - and need special handling to avoid harm to them or their handlers. When they are used to the sight and sound of humans, wild deer can be tamed considerably - especially if they have been hand-reared.</p>

<p>You should handle your deer gently and never rush them. All species of deer handle better in subdued light, so it is strongly recommended that you cover close handling pens.</p>

<p>However there must be sufficient light for you to inspect them and to be able to recognise signs of disease or ill health.</p>

<p>When moving deer through handling systems they should be kept in small groups as far as possible. Individual animals should not be left isolated.</p>

<h3 id="calving-season">Calving season</h3>

<p>Disturbing hinds during calving season should be kept to a minimum. Any essential contact should be carried out by a stock keeper your animals are familiar with. If assisted calving is necessary, some hinds may abandon their calves - so you should have artificial rearing facilities available.</p>

<h3 id="small-deer">Small deer</h3>

<p>The preferred method for handling small deer is to cradle them in your arms with your hands around their hindquarters and the brisket.</p>

<h3 id="large-deer">Large deer</h3>

<p>Larger deer can be safely and effectively pinned against the wall of a pen by putting an arm around the neck, pressing as close to the animal as possible and using a leg to restrain its rear end just in front of the stifle.</p>

<h3 id="inspections-and-record-keeping">Inspections and record keeping</h3>

<p>Regular inspections of your deer are essential to help spot early warning signs of potential health and welfare problems. If you discover any deaths, you should record numbers and keep these records for three years from the date of that inspection.</p>

<p>All deer should be inspected daily during calving time or for housed deer, and twice daily for calves being artificially reared indoors.</p>

<p>Signs of ill health may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>listlessness</li>
  <li>loss of appetite - except the natural loss that occurs each season</li>
  <li>failure to cud</li>
  <li>lameness</li>
  <li>persistent coughing</li>
  <li>swollen joints</li>
  <li>discharge from the nostrils and/or eyes</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also record any medicine you give to your deer and keep these records for three years from the date of treatment. These records must be made available to any authorised person from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> who asks for them.</p>

<h2 id="deer-welfare-at-slaughter-and-fallen-stock">Deer welfare at slaughter and fallen stock</h2>

<p>The welfare of animals at the time of slaughter or killing is covered by an EU directive and UK regulations. These rules state that you must not cause animals and livestock any avoidable stress, pain or suffering. They must also be handled, stunned and killed using specific methods by licensed slaughtermen, although an exception is made for animals killed in the field by a free bullet.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal welfare at slaughter.</p>

<h3 id="slaughter-of-deer">Slaughter of deer</h3>

<p>Field slaughter of deer can be carried out humanely by a trained competent marksman with a suitable rifle.</p>

<p>For tame deer, you should use a frontal head shot at a close range of around 10 to 20 metres. Shooting over distances greater than this should only be attempted in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Shooting should take place when the deer are quiet, such as at a selected regular feeding site when they are being hand fed. Under such circumstances, it may be possible to shoot ten or more deer from a large group before the remainder become unduly disturbed.</p>

<p>A safe backstop for the bullet is essential. As well as taking the necessary precautions for public safety, you must take care while shooting one deer not to injure others. Shooting from an elevated position can help with this.</p>

<p>Avoid shooting too many to leave a small number remaining as they are likely to become unsettled and try to escape.</p>

<h3 id="fallen-stock">Fallen stock</h3>

<p>Fallen stock can be any animal that has:</p>

<ul>
<li>died of natural causes or disease on the farm</li>
  <li>been killed on the farm for reasons other than human consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>Farmers with fallen stock must use approved means and places for their disposal. The National Fallen Stock Company (<abbr title="The National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>) can help with the disposal of fallen stock and advise on the disease prevention rules, as part of the National Fallen Stock Scheme.</p>

<p>If you suspect that an animal has died of a notifiable disease, you must tell your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Office immediately.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

</div>

<p>For more information, see the guide on fallen stock.</p>

<h2 id="movement-identification-and-tracing-of-deer">Movement, identification and tracing of deer</h2>

<p>Those involved with the transport of animals have a legal obligation to ensure their welfare is protected. This applies to farmers, livestock and equine hauliers and commercial pet breeders.</p>

<p>It is an offence if animal welfare is compromised because of a failure to take appropriate action in extreme temperature. You can find out more in the guide on farmed animal welfare during transportation.</p>

<h3 id="deer-tagging">Deer tagging</h3>

<p>Deer must be identified with a tag if they have been tested for bovine tuberculosis or when they leave their farm of origin. The tag must show both the herd number - either the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> or British Deer Farmers Association (<abbr title="British Deer Farmers Association">BDFA</abbr>) herd registration number - and the animal’s own unique number.</p>

<p>Where you decide to use the <abbr title="British Deer Farmers Association">BDFA</abbr> system, you must notify your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Office and supply details of your <abbr title="British Deer Farmers Association">BDFA</abbr> mark. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Tags should be suitable for the breed, size and age of the animal so that the risk of injury is minimised. It is important that ear tagging is carried out correctly to ensure the welfare of your animals and to minimise tag losses.</p>

<p>Eartags for deer are available from sheep and goat eartag manufacturers. <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/95E58D9D5D9C0B7E80256F85004737E1">Find ear tag manufacturers on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="deer-movement">Deer movement</h3>

<p>Deer can be moved under a general licence provided the owner/keeper has not been excluded from the application of any general licences. All movements of deer under the licence need to be reported.</p>

<p>All deer movements must be accompanied by the Standard Movement Document - AML 24. This needs to be filled in as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sections A and C - to be completed by the owner/keeper of the departure holding</li>
  <li>Section B - to be completed by the haulier - or the farmer if moving their own animals</li>
  <li>Section D - to be completed by the owner/keeper of the destination holding</li>
</ul>
<p>The owner/keeper of the destination holding is responsible for ensuring the white copy of the completed movement document is sent to the destination’s local authority. This needs to be done within three days of the move and the destination holding should also keep a copy of the movement document for their own records for six months.</p>

<p>The transporter should also keep a record of the movement for six months. This can be the blue copy of AML 24 or their own document.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal welfare during transportation.</p>

<h3 id="deer-welfare-at-shows-and-markets">Deer welfare at shows and markets</h3>

<p>At market and shows, all animals should be handled humanely by competent people using well-maintained, welfare-friendly equipment.</p>

<p>As deer are sensitive animals, ideally you should not bring them to markets and shows. If you must, separate market days should be arranged in accordance with the <abbr title="British Deer Farmers Association">BDFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal welfare at shows and markets.</p>

<h2 id="further-information-on-deer-health-welfare-and-movement">Further information on deer health, welfare and movement</h2>
