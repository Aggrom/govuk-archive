<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are a farmer with fallen stock, there are approved means and places for its disposal. You can dispose of fallen stock at an approved destination, or you can make arrangements through the National Fallen Stock Company (<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guide explains the rules on the disposal of fallen stock, including how certain cattle must be tested for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (<abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>) - with advice on how to make the necessary arrangements. You will also find guidance on animal incineration rules and the general ban on burying or burning fallen stock in the open. And there’s advice on your options if a horse dies.</p>

<p>This guide provides links to other guides on individual species health, which provide detailed information about dealing with different species of fallen stock. It also references guides on disease prevention and disease notification and restrictions.</p>

<h2 id="disposal-of-fallen-stock">Disposal of fallen stock</h2>

<p>If livestock dies on your farm, burial or burning is not permitted. You must instead arrange for fallen farm animals - including stillborn animals - to be collected by an approved transporter and transported for disposal or an approved treatment to a:</p>

<ul>
<li>knacker</li>
  <li>hunt kennel</li>
  <li>maggot farm</li>
  <li>incinerator</li>
  <li>renderer</li>
</ul>
<p>Carcasses from cattle aged over 48 months must be tested for <abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>. Animal by-products (<abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>) must be transported in covered leak-proof containers/vehicles and be accompanied by a commercial document. You can find more information on <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> in the guide on dealing with animal by-products.</p>

<p>You can dispose of the fallen stock at an approved destination, or you can make arrangements through the National Fallen Stock Scheme. </p>

<p>If you want to make your own arrangements, the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) in your area will provide a list of approved knackers, hunt kennels, maggot farms, incinerators or renderers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Rules for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy testing fallen cattle</p>

<p><abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> is part of a family of diseases known as Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (<abbr title="Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr>). These are fatal brain diseases, which include classical and atypical scrapie in sheep and goats, and <abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> in cattle.</p>

<p>Testing of cattle, sheep and goats for <abbr title="Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr> provides information on the level of these diseases in these animals. This information enables the effectiveness of disease control measures to be assessed and helps to ensure that controls are proportionate to the risk.</p>

<p>Fallen stock must be tested for <abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> if they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>over 48 months of age</li>
  <li>over 24 months of age and born outside Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners in the UK must contact a collector within 24 hours of their animal’s death, to arrange delivery to an approved sampling site within 72 hours of the animal’s death. If they are delivering the carcass themselves, they must contact an approved sampling site to agree this within 24 hours and must deliver the carcass within 72 hours of the animal’s death.</p>

<p>Fallen cattle aged 48 months or under should be disposed of in accordance with <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> legislation.</p>

<p>Animal carcasses or parts of animal carcasses suspected or confirmed as infected by a TSE are category 1 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> - the highest risk category. They must be disposed of by incineration, or processing (rendering) followed by incineration. You can find out about destroying TSE-infected carcasses and specified risk material in the guide on disease prevention.</p>

<h3 id="ban-on-burying-or-burning-fallen-stock-in-the-open">Ban on burying or burning fallen stock in the open</h3>

<p>The burial or burning of fallen stock in the open is banned due to the risk of spreading disease through residues in the soil, groundwater or air pollution. This ban also covers <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>, including afterbirth and stillborn animals.</p>

<h2 id="national-fallen-stock-scheme">National Fallen Stock Scheme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> is a not-for-profit, farmer-led organisation dedicated to delivering a valued service for the farming community. The aims of <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide a national service for the collection and disposal of fallen stock that farmers can choose to use</li>
  <li>create competition at local level to keep prices low</li>
  <li>provide high levels of biosecurity</li>
  <li>assist farmers in complying with Animal By-Product Regulations</li>
  <li>find ways of reducing costs and increasing profits for British livestock producers by investing in research into alternative methods of storage and disposal of fallen stock</li>
</ul>
<p>Farmers and horse owners can register to become a member of the scheme at any time.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-join-the-nfsco">How to join the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You can register by calling the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> Helpline on 0845 054 8888. When registering, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>your contact details</li>
  <li>business name and address - if different from contact details</li>
  <li>addresses for any additional collection points</li>
  <li>bank account details - to set up a variable direct debit mandate</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>VAT number - if applicable</li>
  <li>a description of the type of stock you wish to have collected</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-the-scheme-works">How the scheme works</h3>

<p>The scheme works slightly differently for farmers and horse owners. This page provides information for farmers only.</p>

<p>As a farmer, you can register with the scheme for the collection and disposal of your fallen stock. After becoming a member, you will receive a list of all the approved collectors operating in your local area and the prices that they charge.</p>

<p>When members have fallen stock they can contact a registered collector of their choice. Collectors are required to collect all species for which they have provided prices and are not allowed to refuse any reasonable request to collect stock.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> collectors issue receipts for collecting members’ fallen stock, following a standard procedure. The <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> has a disputes resolution procedure, in case of any problems between collectors and members.</p>

<p>As a member, you pay monthly for any collections by variable direct debit, based on a <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> invoice.</p>

<h3 id="nfsco-biosecurity-guidelines">
<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> biosecurity guidelines</h3>

<p>Collectors and members need to follow <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> biosecurity guidance, as well as any biosecurity procedures put in place by the local authority.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> requires collectors to:</p>

<ul>
<li>clean and disinfect the outside of their vehicles or trailers before arriving at each farm</li>
  <li>clean and disinfect protective clothing between farm premises</li>
  <li>keep fallen stock collection vehicles out of areas where there are livestock</li>
  <li>stay out of these areas themselves</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> requires members with fallen stock to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that collections do not cause biosecurity risks on their premises</li>
  <li>minimise the movements of people, vehicles and equipment into areas with livestock</li>
  <li>remove any fallen stock to areas inaccessible to livestock and wildlife - where possible, to leak-proof, vented and covered containers</li>
</ul>
<p>If you suspect that your stock may be infected with or has died from a notifiable disease, or if you have had sudden or unexpected deaths in your livestock, you must notify your local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> immediately for further investigation. Find out about notifiable diseases on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/notifiable.htm">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<p>For more details on the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>’s biosecurity guidelines, you can call the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> Helpline on 0845 054 8888. You can also find out more about biosecurity in the guide on disease prevention.</p>

<h2 id="exceptions-to-the-ban-on-burning-or-burying-fallen-stock">Exceptions to the ban on burning or burying fallen stock</h2>

<p>The ban on burying or burning fallen stock in the open is to prevent disease being transmitted through infectious residues in the soil, or through the pollution of air or groundwater. In the UK, the only exceptions to this ban are:</p>

<ul>
<li>in remote areas - parts of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, Bardsey Island and Caldy Island in Wales, and the Scilly Isles, Lundy Island and the Isle of Wight in England</li>
  <li>during outbreaks of notifiable disease - if there is a lack of capacity at rendering plants and incinerators, or if transporting carcasses would spread disease</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-farm-incineration-of-animal-by-products">On-farm incineration of animal by-products</h2>

<p>Incinerator plants that only burn animal carcasses or unprocessed parts of carcasses must be approved by the local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>, under the Animal By-Products Regulations (<abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>). You can find more detail on which <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> can be incinterated and how they must be incinerated and composted on the page on composting and incinerating animal by-products in the guide on dealing with animal by-products.</p>

<p>Incinerators which burn any other <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> - eg waste food, manure, bone meal, tallow or other waste not of animal origin - must be approved under the <abbr title="Waste Incineration Directive">WID</abbr>, even if these incinerators also burn animal carcasses or parts of carcasses. Although the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> is not responsible for approving these incinerators, it inspects them to make sure they comply with ABP requirements for record keeping, pest control, transportation and collection of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-permitting-regulations-for-wid-approved-and-abpr-approved-incinerators">Environmental Permitting Regulations for <abbr title="Waste Incineration Directive">WID</abbr>-approved and <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>-approved incinerators</h3>

<p>The Environmental Permitting Regulations aim to protect the environment and people from pollution. Under these regulations, incinerators approved under the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Waste Incineration Directive">WID</abbr> are likely to count as Part A installations. This means that they need environmental permits from the Environment Agency in order to operate.</p>

<p>To gain an environmental permit for a ‘Part A’ incinerator, you have to provide the Environment Agency with information that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>evidence that the incinerator meets <abbr title="Waste Incineration Directive">WID</abbr> requirements for the categories of waste to be incinerated</li>
  <li>plant capacity, categories and quantities of waste, and systems for receiving, storing and handling waste on site</li>
  <li>quality and quantity of residues produced by incineration, and how these are to be handled, stored, minimised or recycled and disposed of</li>
  <li>temperatures and residence time, etc</li>

<p>Non-<abbr title="specified risk material">SRM</abbr> ash from on-farm incineration is a controlled waste and must be disposed of via licensed landfill. Farmers who want to dispose of non-<abbr title="specified risk material">SRM</abbr> ash on-farm need to apply to the Environment Agency for an environmental permit.</p>

<p>There may be some exemptions from this requirement. You can contact the Environment Agency Agricultural Waste Helpline on 0845 603 3113 to find out, and to ask for an exemption application pack.</p>

<h3 id="controls-on-abp-incineration-plants">Controls on ABP incineration plants</h3>

<p>Incinerators approved by the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> for animal carcasses or carcass parts have to comply with the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr> controls, as well as the environmental permits issued by the Environment Agency. The <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr> controls vary according to whether the incinerator is high capacity, low capacity or low capacity type approved.</p>

<p>Low capacity incinerators include most incinerators on farms, hunt kennels, knackers’ yards and pet crematoria.</p>

<p>You can download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s controls on low capacity animal carcass incineration plants information from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264229&amp;id=264230">Agricultural Document Library website (PDF, 94KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="fallen-stock-information-for-horse-owners">Fallen stock information for horse owners</h2>

<p>According to the 2005 <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>, horses are generally categorised as farm animals and their carcasses must be promptly disposed of at an approved site, in the same way as any other fallen stock. </p>

<p>However you can ask your local Trading Standards officers, who are responsible for enforcing the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>, to treat your horse as a pet. If they agree, you may bury your horse, following your local Trading Standards guidelines. These are likely to require horse burial sites to:</p>

<ul>
<li>be at least 250 metres away from any well borehole or spring that supplies water</li>
  <li>be at least 30 metres from any other spring or watercourse, and at least 10 metres from a field drain</li>
  <li>have at least 1 metre of subsoil below the bottom of the burial pit, allowing a hole deep enough for at least 1 metre of soil to cover the carcass</li>
  <li>be free of water at the bottom of the hole, when first dug</li>
</ul>
<p>Find your local trading standards office on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/advice/index.cfm">Trading Standards Institute website.</a></p>

<p>You may also dispose of your pet horse at a pet crematorium.</p>

<h3 id="horse-owners-and-the-nfsco">Horse owners and the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you have already joined the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> in order to dispose of fallen livestock, you can use their collection service for your horse.</p>

<p>If you only want to use the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> for your horses, you might prefer to join before you need its services. </p>

<h3 id="how-the-scheme-works-for-horse-owners">How the scheme works for horse owners</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> sends horse-owning members a list of all the approved fallen stock collectors in the area, and their prices for various services including:</p>

<ul>
<li>disposal only</li>
  <li>having the animal put down by the collector</li>
  <li>collecting an animal after it has been put down by a vet</li>
  <li>an urgent request for attendance</li>
  <li>out of hours attendance</li>
  <li>roadside attendance</li>
  <li>incineration and return of ashes</li>
</ul>
<p>When you require a service, as a <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> member you can make arrangements with your preferred <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> collector. If your horse dies away from the collection point which you registered with <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>, the scheme will try and put you in touch with an approved collector near where your horse has died. However, this may cost extra.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> sends members an invoice for use of its services, which is paid by a variable direct debit mandate set up when you register.</p>
