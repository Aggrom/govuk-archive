<p>The European Regional Development Fund (<abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr>) is aimed at economic regeneration projects promoted primarily by the public sector. This involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>government departments</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>further and higher education establishments</li>
  <li>other public bodies</li>
  <li>volunteer sector organisations</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this by no means excludes the private sector, which promotes and helps to fund high quality projects that meet <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> objectives. That said, <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> grants are not given to profit-making private sector companies, but in certain circumstances the fund can be used to help to develop small and medium-sized enterprises. </p>

<p>Private sector companies are encouraged to present applications in partnership with a public sector body.</p>

<h2 id="access-to-erdf-by-local-enterprise-partnerships">Access to <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> by local enterprise partnerships</h2>

<p>The current round of <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> operational programmes runs from 2007 to 2013. The operational programmes cover specific geographical areas and are aimed at supporting economic regeneration in areas in need. This is through projects in the areas of innovation, business support and sustaining communities.</p>

<p>Local authorities have traditionally received considerable financial support through the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> and in the future it is expected that the approved local enterprise partnerships to also receive funds. Bids for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> support from local enterprise partnerships are encouraged. Any bids from local enterprise partnerships that cover more than one <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> operational programme area will also be considered. </p>

<p>Please speak to your local programme team for further information about this.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-for-erdf">How to apply for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr>
</h2>

<p>On 9 February 2010 the Programme officially launched a £20 million East Midlands Urban Development Fund (‘the Fund’) utilising the <abbr title="Joint European Support for Sustainable Development in City Areas">JESSICA</abbr> initiative to support the development of premises focused on innovation and growth.</p>

<p>The fund will provide much needed investment for schemes - which have been hit hard by the recession and the lack of available finance - that will enhance the region’s offer in terms of innovation, science and technology facilities.</p>

<p>The fund operator (Jones Lang LaSalle) is keen to engage and work closely with East Midlands public and private sector partners to identify potential investments that fit with regional and local priorities and will deliver the best returns for the fund.</p>

<p>For more information about the Fund please visit the <a rel="external" href="http://www.eastmidlandsurbandevelopmentfund.co.uk">East Midlands Urban Development Fund website.</a></p>

<p>For more information contact the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> programme delivery team: East Midlands on 0303 444 6427 or email <a href="mailto:em.erdfenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk">em.erdfenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Partners in Derby have agreed a common vision for the city’s economy based upon four aspirations:</p>

<ul>
<li>building a portfolio of higher value, knowledge-based employment</li>
  <li>ensuring the city is a location of choice</li>
  <li>energising all Derby’s communities</li>
  <li>responding to the challenges and opportunities of climate change.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="european-regional-development-fund-priority-axis-2-funding---extended-call-for-outline-applications">European Regional Development Fund Priority Axis 2 funding - extended call for outline applications</h4>

<p>As part of the current EU Competitiveness and Employment programme, under the European Regional Development Fund 2007-13, Derby city has been awarded funding through Priority Axis 2. The focus of this priority axis is to provide support and resources to localities, with high levels of deprivation and low levels of economic activity, in order to increase sustainable economic and enterprise activity.</p>

<p>You are invited to apply for funding to support the delivery of this European programme in Derby city. </p>

<p>Due to a disappointing response, there is an extension to the deadline for outline applications. Applications are invited from organisations that have existing projects or new project proposals which will help achieve the outcomes set out in Derby’s <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Local Investment Plan.</p>

<p>A ‘drop-in surgery’ is being held on 10 October on the 3rd floor of St Peters House in Derby, from 10am to 4pm. This offers you the opportunity to discuss your project ideas with staff from the city council and the Department for Communities and Local Government, to see if your project is eligible to apply for this funding.</p>

<p>Outline applications must be submitted to Derby City Council by 12 noon on Friday 26 October 2012.</p>

<p>For more information please contact Michelle Nally at Derby City Council by telephone on 01332 256903, or email at <a href="mailto:MichelleN@derbycitypartnership.co.uk">MichelleN@derbycitypartnership.co.uk</a></p>

<p>Indicative funding allocations have been agreed for the second half of the programme 2011-13 where for Lincolnshire the disadvantaged communities are Lincoln City and East Lindsey. Boston has been allocated transition funding as this is no longer one of the 12 most disadvantaged districts in the East Midlands.</p>

<p>Lincolnshire will continue to operate as a combined Local Investment Plan so that Lincoln, East Lindsey and Boston work collectively to ensure activity and investment is strategically linked.  The Second Half Investment Plan 2011 to 2013 and Lincolnshire’s Combined Investment Plan both need to be referred to when making a case for funding under Priority Axis 2.</p>

<p>The Lincolnshire programme is currently accepting expressions of interest on a rolling programme basis subject to availability of funds.</p>

<h3 id="calls-for-proposals-1">Calls for proposals</h3>

<p>There are currently no calls for proposals open.</p>

<p>Details of any forthcoming calls will be publicised on the website and through regular practitioner network e-bulletins.</p>

<h3 id="making-an-outline-application">Making an outline application</h3>

<p>An outline application is the first stage of applying for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> funding. Outline applications may only be submitted in response to a call for proposals.</p>

<p>The outline application asks for basic project details that will enable the local <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> programme delivery team to assess the project against the project selection criteria set out in the relevant commissioning document and test its eligibility for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> support.</p>

<p>Before completing an outline application form you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>read the accompanying guidance notes.</li>
  <li>carefully consider the information within the relevant call document.</li>
  <li>consider national <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> documents available from the ‘National guidance’ section of this website, that have been produced to support the development and management of <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> projects.</li>
  <li>consider local <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> guidance on the outputs and results projects must deliver, available from the ‘Local guidance’ section of this website</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that applications will only be accepted if they are made using the outline application form and that all outline applications must include a completed financial annexe.</p>

<h3 id="making-a-full-application">Making a full application</h3>

<p>Please note the local <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> team will only accept full applications for projects that have been formally selected for inclusion in the programme.</p>

<p>The full <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> application requires the provision of a significant level of detail. You will find it much easier to complete the full application if you are aware of the questions it asks during the project development process. As you will then be able to collect relevant information and evidence and begin to put in place appropriate project management systems.</p>

<p>Once a project has been selected for inclusion in the programme you will be given a full application pack.</p>

<p>The time taken for a project to progress from the outline stage to full application and then through to approval varies significantly depending upon the size and nature of the project. Once a project is selected for inclusion in the programme the local <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> team will agree a timetable for the submission and appraisal of your full application.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-funding-in-the-north-west">Applying for funding in the North West</h2>

<p>The North West delivery team allocates North West operational programme funding through a single appraisal process. In order for a project to be successful in applying for funding, the project must fulfill the criteria of the investment framework relevant to the type of project. There are 11 investment frameworks which cover 11 action areas over 4 priority areas. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply-open-calls">How to apply: open calls</h3>

<p>Over the life of the North West operational programme, the North West European programme executive will formally call for project proposals to come forward. For each call, the investment frameworks will clearly set out the nature of the activity covered by the call, together with the required outcomes, outputs and impacts expected from investment.</p>

<p>Potential applicants will be required to register their interest by approaching the programme delivery team with their project idea. With support from the local  team, applicants with eligible proposals will then be invited to submit an outline application using the form available from the ‘National guidance’ section.</p>

<p>The outline application will be assessed against agreed project selection criteria which tests the project idea against the requirements of the appropriate investment framework.</p>

<p>Successful projects will proceed to the development of a full application. These will also be subject to an independent appraisal before any offer of <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> funding can be approved.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply-non-competitive-selection">How to apply: non-competitive selection</h3>

<p>The local management committee, regional partners and the European Commission have agreed the use of non-competitive selection for a limited number of projects identified in the North West operational programme. These projects will be subject to full <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> assessment and appraisal before approval can be granted and need to contribute to: business support; regional productivity; and access to finance.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p>The local programme delivery team makes decisions in respect of eligibility. It also advises applicants on the eligibility of projects, activities and costs as part of the project development process.</p>

<p>Eligibility for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> funding will be tested against a number of criteria including the European Commission Regulations: No 1083/2006 and No 1080/2006, the investment priorities set out in the North West operational programme, the detailed specifications set out in the investment frameworks, <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> basic, core and appraisal criteria and the national eligibility rules.</p>

<p>Full details on sectors, activities and costs that are ineligible can be obtained from the local delivery team.</p>

<p>Each Action Area is driven by a comprehensive Investment Framework which details the types of activity to be funded and identifies the types of organisations that are best placed to deliver such projects. North West Operational Programme funding is allocated in accordance with these Investment Frameworks.</p>

<p>Each Investment Framework has been developed in consultation with local, sub-regional and regional partners and approved by the Local Management Committee.</p>

<p>A number of the Investment Frameworks are subject to limited bidding or non-competitive selection. The requirements of each Investment Framework are detailed under each Action Area.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard North West Operational Programme funding, there is a Venture Capital and Loan Fund to support high growth start-ups, as part of Priority 1: Action Area 1.</p>

<p>These Investment Framework documents are available to download below.</p>

<p>The different Investment Frameworks guide the use of funding under the North West Operational Programme allocated to each Action Area. Each Investment Framework has a number of strands/requirements which the different projects need to fulfil. Each Investment Framework has a breakdown of the design principles; match funding criteria; and a description of activity supported.</p>

<p>The Investment Frameworks also cover the project selection method, which forms part of the selection process.</p>

<p>Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly Convergence partners agreed to adopt a commissioning approach to maximise the impact of the Programme by investing in a few, strategic investments closely aligned to Operational Programme priorities. This means that grant recipients do not ‘bid’ for funding but are commissioned to work up proposals, often following a call for Expressions of Interest. Any calls for Expressions of Interest will be published below.</p>

<p>The Grant for Business Investment is a specific grant scheme managed by the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Secretariat which can support businesses to bring forward capital projects leading to long-term improvements in productivity, skills and employment. Further information on the scheme can be accessed below.</p>

<p>The programme is investing in a wide range of business support, training, employment space and infrastructure which will support individuals and businesses across Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Further information about the range of investments is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.convergencecornwall.com/">Convergence Cornwall</a> website.</p>

<h3 id="grant-for-business-investment">Grant for business investment</h3>

<p>Grant for business investment offers grant support for sustainable business investment and job creation projects in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, and is part of a suite of highly targeted, publicly funded products and services known as Solutions for Business.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Secretariat manages the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Grant for Business Investment scheme aimed at businesses of all sizes looking to invest in the areas supported by the Convergence Programme and who need a grant to take their vision forward.</p>

<p>The scheme focuses support on high-quality, innovative, knowledge-based projects that lead to long-term improvements in productivity, skills and employment. The majority of jobs created are expected to be at NVQ Level 2 and above.</p>

<p>Projects such as launching a new business, expanding existing companies, introducing new technology into manufacturing, or taking a new product into production will be eligible for support.</p>

<p>Each application has to meet certain criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>demonstrate strong additionally (need for grant) and proven need for financial support</li>
  <li>display quality features, such as good skills levels and productivity growth measured by Gross Value Added</li>
  <li>projects must be funded mainly by the applicant or from other private sector sources</li>
  <li>projects must involve capital investment on fixed assets such as property or machinery</li>
  <li>projects must create new jobs or safeguard existing employment above the average skill levels</li>
  <li>projects should be viable, competitive and profitable</li>
  <li>projects should not be irrevocably committed prior to the application</li>
  <li>projects should provide positive benefits to both the local and national economy</li>
  <li>supply markets other than local without displacement of similar businesses</li>
  <li>contribute towards the programme’s low carbon ambitions</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum threshold for grant applications is £10,000. Grants will be appraised within the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Secretariat and subject to peer appraisal by partners who understand the confidentiality of the applications.</p>

<h3 id="jobs-and-skills">Jobs and skills</h3>

<p>Projects must create new jobs or safeguard existing employment. The more your project increases skills and involves investment in the skills base, the more value will be placed on this criterion when considering support. A compulsory test requires all applicants to achieve a weighted average of at least NVQ Level 2 measured by reference to the Standard Occupation Codes 2000.</p>

<h3 id="productivity-and-gva">Productivity and <abbr title="Gross Value Added">GVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Productivity remains one of the key tests, but productivity is driven by five main factors: skills, investment, innovation, enterprise and competition, are looking for evidence of all of these in applications. A copy of the spreadsheet used to calculate growth in Gross Value Added per Full-Time Equivalent is freely available. Gross Value Added will form part of the initial appraisal process which we will use to evaluate your project against the performance of your business sector.</p>

</section><h2 id="applying-for-funding-in-the-west-midlands">Applying for funding in the West Midlands</h2>

<h3 id="calls-for-projects-and-expressions-of-interest">Calls for projects and expressions of interest</h3>

<p>This section provides information on all the open and limited calls for outline application under the West Midlands <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Programme 2007 to 2013. It also provides information on how to apply.</p>

<h3 id="making-an-application">Making an application</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Programme is split into a number of priority areas. This section sets out how projects come forward under each priority area and the process for making an application. </p>

<h3 id="how-funding-is-awarded-under-priorities-1-and-2">How funding is awarded under Priorities 1 and 2</h3>

<p>The usual method by which projects are invited to come forward into Priority 1 and 2 is via open bidding rounds. By exception, projects may be introduced via a limited bidding round (when only certain types of organisation may be invited to respond to the call) or very exceptionally by non competitive selection, when there is only one organisation who appears to be the only suitable and capable vehicle for delivering a specific operation.</p>

<p>A high level plan for each priority, called the Investment Framework sets out what funding is available for open and limited bidding against each area of activity. The decision to initiate a bidding round is made by the Local Management Sub-Committee.</p>

<p>When a bidding round is launched, a prospectus is published on the website setting out the Priority under which we are seeking bids, the sort of activity we are looking to support, the amount of <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> available, the launch and closing date for the rounds and the parameters for selection. The prospectus is agreed with the Local Management Sub-Committee. </p>

<p>You can sign up to the e-mail distribution list to receive an automatic alert each time a new call is launched by emailing <a href="mailto:WM.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk">WM.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a> with your details.</p>

<h3 id="how-funding-is-awarded-under-priority-3">How funding is awarded under priority 3</h3>

<p>Priority 3 operates differently from the other Priorities in that it is implemented via an area based package approach. A Package is a group of related projects in a closely defined urban area which has been identified as having high levels of economic need and opportunity. Six Packages were identified in the following geographic areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>North Staffordshire</li>
  <li>Coventry and Nuneaton </li>
  <li>Birmingham</li>
  <li>Solihull</li>
  <li>North Black Country</li>
  <li>South Black Country</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Package is coordinated by a Package Manager who is responsible for the production and overall coordination of a Package Plan encompassing a suite of projects which realise the strategic benefits, specific actions and outputs outlined under Priority 3.</p>

<p>Package Managers perform the key role of Strategic Coordinators developing projects with local partners through better leverage and alignment of activity at the relevant spatial level and bringing them forward through the Package. This approach is designed to maximise impact, ensure high levels of added value, and reduce duplication of activity.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h3>

<p>For priority 1, 2, 4 and 5, we recommend that you read through the information on the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> pages of this website then contact the relevant Priority Manager listed on the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> West Midlands local contacts document available below, to talk through your application. They can advise on the eligibility of your application and when the next bidding round is anticipated.</p>

<p>Details of all current bidding rounds will be made available on this website.</p>

<p>For priority 3, contact the relevant Package Manager.</p>

<h3 id="application-form-and-guidance">Application form and guidance</h3>

<p>When applying for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> funding there are two stages that projects progress through - an outline proposal and a full application. The key documents for both stages can be found on the National Guidance section.</p>

<p>For more information contact the Programme Delivery Team: West Midlands on 0303 444 6590 or email <a href="mailto:WM.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk">WM.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="calls-for-proposals-3">Calls for proposals</h3>

<p>There are currently no live calls for proposals under the West Midlands <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Programme.</p>

<p>Details of all future calls will be published on this page. </p>

<p>To receive notification when a new bidding call is launched, email your details to <a href="mailto:WEST_MIDS_ERDF_TEAM@communities.gsi.gov.uk">WEST_MIDS_ERDF_TEAM@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="applying-for-funding-in-yorkshire-and-the-humber">Applying for funding in Yorkshire and the Humber</h2>

<h3 id="calls-for-proposals-4">Calls for proposals</h3>

<p>Applications for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> investment from Yorkshire and the Humber’s programme are invited in response to time-limited calls for proposals. Calls are published here, however, there are no open call for proposals at this time.</p>

<h3 id="application-process-and-forms">Application Process and Forms</h3>

<p>To apply for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> from Yorkshire and the Humber’s programme, applicants should submit an Outline Application using the form available from the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Forms section of the website. </p>

<p>Completed Outline Application Forms, accompanied by a completed Outline Application Deliverables, Costs and Funding Annex spreadsheet, should be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:YH.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk">YH.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a> Guidance on completing these is available from the <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> Guidance section.</p>

<p>If applicants would like to discuss an application before submission, they should contact the Programme Delivery Team on 0303 444 6640 or by email to the address above.</p>

<p>Please note that match funding must be identified, but not necessarily secured, before an Outline Application is submitted as <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> provides gap funding for project proposals.</p>

<p>Once the Outline Application is developed to an acceptable standard it is then presented to the local Performance Management Boards (a sub group of the Local Management Committee) for a decision whether it will be asked to develop a full application.</p>

<p>Prior to consideration by Performance Management Boards all Outline Applications will be published on this website for 10 working days for information and to allow partners, if they wish, to comment.</p>

<p>Applicants with Outline Applications that are selected will be invited to submit a Full Application. </p>

<p>For more information contact the Programme Delivery Team: Yorkshire and The Humber on 0303 444 6640 or email <a href="mailto:YH.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk">YH.ERDFenquiries@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="outline-applications">Outline applications</h3>

<p>The Yorkshire and Humber <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> programme does not currently have any outline applications open for partner comment.</p>
