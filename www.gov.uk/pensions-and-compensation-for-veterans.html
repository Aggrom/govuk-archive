<p>As part of Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>), the Veterans Services Directorate are responsible for the assessment, award, payment and maintenance of all pensions relating to the Armed Forces. </p>

<p>These include occupational pensions; The Armed Forces Pension Schemes (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>), war disablement pensions, war widows’ pensions, related allowances and other payments to service veterans. They also administer ex-gratia payments scheme to former prisoners of the Japanese in WW2.</p>

<p>In addition, the Directorate undertake the assessment, award and maintenance of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Compensation Scheme">AFCS</abbr>) claims plus the presentation of appeals to the independent Pensions Appeal Tribunals (PAT) for both current and former service personnel.</p>

<p>There are currently 2 Armed Forces Pension Schemes (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>) available to service leavers; <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 and <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05</p>

<h3 id="have-you-served-in-the-military-since-1975">Have you served in the military since 1975?</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>It is possible that you have earned a preserved pension payable at age 60 (or 65 if you joined after April 2006). Read the following to see if you qualify and follow the links for the application forms if you do.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="pensions-1">Pensions</h3>

<p>There are currently 2 Armed Forces Pension Schemes (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>) available to service leavers; <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 and <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05.</p>

<p><abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 pension benefits are based on rank and length of Service. All personnel serving between 6 April 1975 and 6 April 2005 will have served under the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 scheme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 pension benefits are based on length of Service and final salary and personnel who joined after 6 April 2005 will be serving under the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 scheme. However, personnel serving between July 2005 and March 2006 were given the option to move to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 as part of the Offer to Transfer process
There are some fundamental differences between the schemes that cover both retired benefits and dependents benefits. To find out what benefits personnel are entitled to, click on the link below and download the booklets that are applicable to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> that you/your spouse are/were serving under.</p>

<h3 id="service-preserved-pensions">Service Preserved Pensions</h3>

<p>Prior to 06 April 1975 there was no provision for a preservation of pension benefits and service personnel who left the Armed Forces had to have completed 16 years from age 21 (Officers) or 22 years from age 18 (Other ranks). Those who left before that date without completing the above criteria, lost all pension entitlement.</p>

<p>The rules changed on 06 April 1975 to provide for pensions to be preserved for payment at age 60 for all those discharged over the age of 26 with a minimum of 5 years service. On 06 April 1988, the qualifying period was reduced from 5 to 2 years and the age criterion was dropped. Preserved pensions have to be claimed at age 60 or at age 65 if your service began after 5 April 2006. However, you can claim your preserved pension sooner if you become permanently incapacitated.</p>

<p>Service pensions are administered by the <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> but pension payments are made by Paymaster (1836) Ltd, the paying authority for the Armed Forces pension Scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="what-armed-forces-attributable-benefits-are">What Armed Forces Attributable Benefits are</h3>

<p>Armed Forces Attributable Benefits are paid where the injury, illness or death was caused by service before 6 April 2005.  The benefits are paid under the attributable rules of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975.  The benefits are paid to Regular personnel (and surviving dependents) if they are medically discharged as a result of service.  The rules provide for a minimum income guarantee according to the individual’s rank and the assessment of the degree of disablement.</p>

<p>A separate stand-alone scheme containing these rules will be introduced by April 2010.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-eligible">Who is eligible</h3>

<p>In order to receive benefits you must have been medically discharged from service and receive a War Disablement Pension from the War Pensions Scheme for your principal invaliding condition.  Once a Service Invaliding Pension has been awarded by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>), the case is automatically referred to the Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Veterans Agency">VA</abbr>) to consider if a War Disablement Pension  is paid; if so the case is then sent back to <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> for consideration for <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 attributable award.</p>

<p>The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Compensation Scheme">AFCS</abbr>) is for all members of the Regular and Reserve Forces, providing compensation for all injuries, ill-health and death due to service on or after 6 April 2005.</p>

<p>A new Armed Forces pension scheme will be introduced from April 2015. The new scheme will include the opportunity to buy AVCs and further information will be published once the details are finalised.</p>
</div>

<p>Members of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 have the option of purchasing AVCs to buy added years.</p>

<p>Members of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 have the option of purchasing several different types of AVCs, including added years. These AVCs will continue to be available, unchanged, in accordance with HMRC and current schemes’ rules, up to the introduction of the new pension scheme in April 2015.</p>

<p>Service personnel within ten years of their current scheme’s Normal Pension Age (<abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr>) on 1 April 2012 (i.e. Regulars aged 45 or over on 1 April 2012) qualify
for ‘transitional protection’ and will remain in their current pension scheme. The current rules on AVCs will continue to apply beyond April 2015.</p>

<p>Service personnel without transitional protection will move onto the new pension scheme in April 2015. Details of the impact on existing AVCs are set out in DIN 2012 01-249 which can be found on the Defence Intranet.</p>

</ul>
<p>Please see the top of this page for information regarding the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme and affects on AVCs.</p>

<p>For those Service personnel who are moved onto the new pension scheme in April 2015, payments in respect of this AVC, and the benefit cover, will stop
in April 2015. This is because the new scheme will automatically provide comparable benefits to those being purchased. Members will not have any
accrued rights (including no entitlement to a refund of premiums already paid), as the DIS AVC is an insurance-type arrangement providing ongoing
cover while AVC payments continue, and with no refund payable if the member does not die in service during payment of the AVC.</p>

<p>Those purchasing this AVC will secure a lump sum death benefit in the event of the member’s death in service of the greater of: either four times what the member’s representative rate of pay would have been if the member had had the maximum amount of reckonable service permitted; or four times the member’s annual pensionable earnings at the date of death.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-armed-forces-attributable-benefits">What are Armed Forces Attributable Benefits</h3>

<p>Armed Forces Attributable Benefits are paid where the injury, illness or death was caused by service before 6 April 2005. The benefits are paid under the attributable rules of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975.  </p>

<p>The benefits are paid to Regular personnel (and surviving dependents) if they are medically discharged as a result of service. The rules provide for a minimum income guarantee according to the individual’s rank and the assessment of the degree of disablement.</p>

<p>A separate stand-alone scheme containing these rules will be introduced by April 2010.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-eligible-1">Who is eligible?</h3>

<p>In order to receive benefits you must have been medically discharged from service and receive a War Disablement Pension from the War Pensions Scheme for your principal invaliding condition. Once a Service Invaliding Pension has been awarded by the <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>, the case is automatically referred to the Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Veterans Agency">VA</abbr>) to consider if a War Disablement Pension  is paid; if so the case is then sent back to <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> for consideration for <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 attributable award.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-the-injury-illness-or-death-is-caused-on-or-after-6-april-2005">What if the injury, illness or death is caused on or after 6 April 2005?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Armed Forces Compensation Scheme">AFCS</abbr> is for all members of the Regular and Reserve Forces, providing compensation for all injuries, ill-health and death due to service on or after 6 April 2005.</p>

<h3 id="graves">Graves</h3>

<h4 id="world-war-graves-and-non-world-war-graves">World War Graves and Non-World War Graves</h4>

<p>Members of the Armed Forces who died during either of the two World Wars, between 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921, and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 are buried in official World War graves. The graves of Service personnel who died after 1947 are categorised as non-World War graves. The definition of non-World War graves also encompasses the graves of those Service dependents who died overseas, while accompanying Service personnel, and are buried in military cemeteries.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s commitment to the maintenance of Service graves is largely determined by the age of the grave. </p>

<p>a. Pre-World War I. Before World War I, the burying of the deceased was traditionally a function of the Ship or Regiment to which they belonged. No formal assistance was offered by the, then, Admiralty or War Office, and only a limited number of such graves are maintained at <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s expense. These are generally graves located in a military cemetery funded by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> where all graves are maintained automatically and failure to do so would detract from the overall appearance of the cemetery.</p>

<p>b. World War 1 and 2. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) was established and is funded to provide a permanent official commemoration for those who died in the two World Wars. It maintains in perpetuity the graves and the official memorials which commemorate those who have no known graves. The CWGC’s principle of non-repatriation of war dead was implemented for both World Wars so that those who fought and fell together could be honoured together. The UK Government, one of the six member Commonwealth countries supporting the CWGC, contributes over 78% of the funding for this work which is proportionate to our number of war dead.</p>

<p>c. The Inter-War Years. Between 1 September 1921 and 2 September 1939, responsibility for Service burials reverted to the pre-1914 arrangements whereby Ships, Regiments and Units buried their own dead without central assistance. However, dependent on Service, some casualties were provided with an official headstone and, in some instances, they received a Service (as distinct from a private) funeral. Exceptionally, these relatively few graves are maintained at public expense. As with pre-World War I graves, inter-war year graves may be maintained at public expense if they are located in a military cemetery funded by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> where all graves are maintained automatically and failure to do so would detract from the overall appearance of the cemetery.</p>

<p>d. Since 1 January 1948, it has been the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s policy that if a member of the Armed Forces dies in service, their next of kin (NOK) are offered the opportunity of the individual having a Service funeral and official headstone, to be maintained in perpetuity at public expense. </p>

<p>i. Service personnel and, if serving overseas, their accompanying dependents, who died post 1 January 1948, were buried in non-World War graves locally or could be repatriated at private expense for a private funeral. </p>

<p>ii. In 1963, the UK Government’s policy of non-repatriation changed and if Service personnel or their accompanying dependents died whilst serving in North West Europe, next of kin were allowed the choice of either repatriating and burying the body at public expense or for two relatives to travel out to attend the Service funeral overseas. </p>

<p>iii. In 1967, the policy was extended to cover the rest of the world. </p>

<p>iv. It was decided at the time that these arrangements would not be retrospective. However, Service personnel, or their accompanying dependents, who died whilst serving overseas after 1 January 1948 can be repatriated at private expense for a private funeral.</p>

<h4 id="private-graves">Private graves</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> will maintain in perpetuity the graves of all personnel who died in Service on or after 1 January 1948, who had both a Service funeral and a Service headstone, and the grave has been registered to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. Where the NOK elect to have a private funeral, or choose a non-<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> pattern headstone, the graves are maintained privately and the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has no responsibility for them.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-armed-forces-pension-scheme">The Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme</h2>

<p>The Defence Secretary announced in October 2012 that final agreement with the government on the overall design of the new Armed Forces Pension scheme has been reached. This new Armed Forces Pension Scheme, currently known as the Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme">FAFPS</abbr>), will be introduced in April 2015. </p>

<p>All service personnel who are members of an Armed Forces pension scheme and who will be serving beyond April 2015 will automatically be transferred into the new scheme (unless they qualify for Transitional Protection - see Transitional Protection section).</p>

<p>The key features of the new scheme remain unchanged from the Outline Scheme Design published at the end of July 2012 but will now also include additional choice in how the Early Departure Payment (<abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr>) may be taken, depending on individual needs.  </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr> will normally be paid as a monthly income and one-off lump sum.  However, in light of views expressed by service personnel during consultation, the new scheme will also offer the choice to forego the lump sum and convert it into additional monthly income. This additional option is not currently available to members of any current Armed Forces Pension Scheme.</p>

</section><h3 id="accrued-rights-to-existing-pension-benefits">Accrued rights to existing pension benefits</h3>

<p>Rights to pension benefits accrued by service personnel as a result of their membership of current pension schemes are protected.</p>

<p>This means pension benefits already earned in current schemes, up to the implementation date of the new scheme, will be guaranteed. Service personnel will be able to draw these benefits at the same age as now (in accordance with current scheme’s rules) and they will be linked to the final pensionable salary at the date of leaving the services - not the salary/rank at the time of transfer to the new scheme - thereby maintaining their final salary link.</p>

<h3 id="transitional-protection">Transitional Protection</h3>

<p>The government has offered Transitional Protection for those who were within 10 years of their respective scheme’s Normal Pension Age (<abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr>) on 1 April 2012.</p>

<p><abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97 (Full Commitment) have a <abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr> of 55. <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr>, <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97 (on Limited or Home Commitment) and NRPS have a <abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr> of 60.</p>

<p>This means if you are a member of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 or <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97 (FC) and were aged 45 or over on 1 April 2012, you will stay on your current pension scheme and your benefits will be unaffected.</p>

<p>If you are a member of the <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> (including those on Additional Duties Commitment), <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97 (on LC or HC) or NRPS and were aged 50 or over on 1 April 2012, you will remain in your current pension scheme and your benefits will be unaffected.</p>

<p>This Transitional Protection was a government decision for all public service schemes, for those personnel who were nearest to their <abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr> and who will, therefore, have less time to adjust their financial plans in response to the changes to their pension scheme. Approximately 7,800 officers and 7,000 other ranks will benefit from Transitional Protection.</p>

<h3 id="pension-forecasts">Pension forecasts</h3>

<p>The pensions calculator does not yet take into account the effect of transition to the new scheme, so forecasts are no longer complete projections of future entitlement beyond 2015.</p>

<p>Work to create a revised calculator to allow service personnel to forecast their pension benefits should be available in 2013.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the calculator will still provide a general guide to benefit entitlement for those due to retire before 2015 and those covered by Transitional Protection.</p>

<h3 id="background-on-the-development-of-the-new-scheme">Background on the development of the new scheme</h3>

<p>The Independent Public Service Pensions Commission (<abbr title="Independent Public Service Pensions Commission">IPSPC</abbr>) </p>

<p>In 2010 , the government asked Lord Hutton of Furness to chair the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission (<abbr title="Independent Public Service Pensions Commission">IPSPC</abbr>). The <abbr title="Independent Public Service Pensions Commission">IPSPC</abbr> made its final report on March 2011 and recommended changes to all public service pensions, including those for the Armed Forces. </p>

<h3 id="the-governments-response">The government’s response</h3>

<p>In light of the <abbr title="Independent Public Service Pensions Commission">IPSPC</abbr>’s final report, the government set out its preferred scheme design for public service pension schemes in the HM Treasury paper ‘Public Service Pensions: good pensions that last’ in November 2011.</p>

<h3 id="consultation">Consultation</h3>

<p>The Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme team conducted a two phase consultation process. The initial phase in 2012 gathered the views of service personnel and other interested parties via an initial consultation document, questionnaire, focus groups and briefings. The final phase, concluded in September 2012 and involved the publication of the Outline Scheme Design document, an accompanying video and a further opportunity to submit views through a comments site. In excess of 25,000 service personnel participated in both phases of the consultation.</p>

<h3 id="legislation">Legislation</h3>

<p>A Public Service Pensions Bill was laid before Parliament on 13 September 2012 which includes a commitment to no substantive changes for 25 years.  The Bill covers all public service pensions. Further legislation specific to the new Armed Forces Scheme will follow in due course.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has conducted an <a href="EIA%20doc.pdf">Equalities Impact Analysis</a> on the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme.</p>

<p>The Government Actuary’s Department has produced a report into the cost of the final scheme design see <a href="Cost%20FSA%20doc.pdf">Cost of Final Scheme Design</a></p>

<h2 id="new-armed-forces-pension-scheme-faqs">New Armed Forces pension scheme FAQs</h2>

<h3 id="when-will-the-new-armed-forces-pension-scheme-start">When will the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme start?</h3>
<p>The new Armed Forces Pension Scheme will be introduced from April 2015.  The government 
recognises that the unique nature of the Armed Forces schemes means it might take a little 
longer than other schemes to reach a final design, but all new public service pension schemes 
are planning to come into effect from April 2015.  </p>

<h3 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h3>
<p>You may be affected if you are still serving in the Armed Forces when the new pension 
scheme is introduced (not before April 2015).  This includes members of the Armed Forces Pension Schemes 1975 and 2005 (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 and <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05), including the Military Provost Guard Service, as well as members of the NonRegular Permanent Staff (NRPS), Full Time Reserve Service 1997 pension scheme (<abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97), Reserve Forces Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr>) and the Gurkha Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Gurkha Pension Scheme">GPS</abbr>).  The Gibraltar Regiment Pension Scheme is subject to review and further details will be published in due course.  </p>

<p>Transfer to the new scheme will be compulsory (unless exempt through transitional protection 
– see below).  This is in line with government policy for all new public service pension 
schemes. If you are due to leave the services before April 2015 you won’t be affected.</p>

<p>The government has offered transitional protection for those within 10 years of their 
respective scheme’s Normal Pension Age (<abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr>) on 1 April 2012.  <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 and 
<abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97 (Full Commitment) have a <abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr> of 55.  <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr>, <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97 (on Limited or Home 
Commitment) and NRPS have a <abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr> of 60. This means if you are a member of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 or <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 97 (FC) and were aged 45 or over on 1 April 2012, you will stay on your current pension scheme and your benefits will be unaffected.  </p>

<p>If you are a member of the <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> (including those on Additional Duties Commitment), <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> 
97 (on LC or HC) or NRPS and were aged 50 or over on 1 April 2012, you will remain in your 
current pension scheme and your benefits will be unaffected.  </p>

<h3 id="how-does-transitional-protection-work">How does Transitional Protection work?</h3>
<p>The government offered this protection to those personnel who were nearest to their 
normal pension age and therefore with less time to adjust their financial plans to reflect the 
changes to their pension scheme. Approximately 7,800 officers and 7,000 other ranks 
benefit from transitional protection. If you are covered by transitional protection then you stay on your existing scheme.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-covered-by-transitional-protection-but-want-to-serve-to-age-60-can-i-do-this">I am covered by Transitional Protection but want to serve to age 60, can I do this?</h3>
<p>Possibly.  Although terms of service (<abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr>) and pension are linked they are not inseparable 
so it may be possible to remain on your current scheme and serve to age 60 (as can happen 
now, although it is unusual).  The three services are still working out how to change <abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr> to 
reflect the changes to the early departure payment point and the normal pension age. A lot will depend on whether the services need your skills.</p>

<h3 id="other-schemes-offer-further-protection-to-those-with-just-over-10-years-left-to-their-10-year-normal-pension-age-will-the-mod">Other schemes offer further protection to those with just over 10 years left to their 10 year normal pension age. Will the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>?</h3>

<p>No. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has decided not to extend this protection for the Armed Forces (for example for 
those aged 40 to 45 years). If we were to extend this protection, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> would need to fund this from within, which would mean reducing benefits for all service personnel without transitional 
protection.  </p>

<h3 id="my-terms-of-service-do-not-allow-me-to-serve-to-55-will-i-get-10-years-protection-working-back-from-my-retirement-date">My terms of service do not allow me to serve to 55. Will I get 10 years’ protection working back from my retirement date?</h3>

<p>No. Transitional protection is tied to your pension scheme’s normal pension age, not your 
personal retirement age.  While you may have an earlier normal retirement age (<abbr title="Normal Retirement Age">NRA</abbr>), the 
Armed Forces pension schemes have an <abbr title="Normal Pension Age">NPA</abbr> of 55 for regulars and and <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr>(FC) and 60 for all other reservists.  The setting of the <abbr title="Normal Retirement Age">NRA</abbr> is based on operational requirements for each service or specialism, and forms part of <abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr>.  Future <abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr> are being considered by the single services but until any changes are made you will still have to leave your service at <abbr title="Normal Retirement Age">NRA</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="im-a-reservist---do-i-get-a-pension-under-the-new-scheme">I’m a reservist - do I get a pension under the new scheme?</h3>
<p>Possibly. As currently happens, reservists who sign up to a full time reserve service 
commitment or an additional duties commitment (part-time), or those who are mobilised for a 
period of service, may choose to have this period counted in the new scheme.  Under the new 
scheme such service will qualify for pension benefit, but a reservist, along with regulars, will not 
qualify for a deferred pension until they have completed the requisite cumulative 2 years’ 
qualifying service. </p>

<h3 id="im-a-reservist-why-dont-i-receive-a-pension-for-attending-training-on-man-training-days">I’m a reservist, why don’t I receive a pension for attending training on man training days?</h3>
<p>Currently, when undertaking man training days (ie. attendance at drill nights, weekend training 
and annual continuous training), reservists do not accrue benefits under the existing reserve 
pension scheme, but are instead contracted into the state second pension scheme.  This will 
continue to be the case in the new scheme.  Although the bounty is not paid as a direct substitute 
for pensions, it is part of a reservist’s overall remuneration package.  A study by the Government 
Actuary’s Department showed that the vast majority of reservists were better off receiving the 
bounty than they would be if they were members of the reserve forces pension scheme.  We 
could consider the option of allowing all reservists to join the new scheme, but at the same time, 
would remove entitlement to the bounty.  This would reduce significantly a reservist’s overall 
remuneration, as 28 days worth of the new pension scheme per year would certainly be worth far less than the annual bounty. </p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-pension-i-have-built-up-prior-to-transferring">What about the pension I have built up prior to transferring?</h3>
<p>The government has said the benefits you have already built up in your existing pension 
scheme (known as ‘accrued rights’) will be protected.  Accrued rights vary from scheme to 
scheme but the value of pension benefits earned, up to the introduction of the new scheme, 
will be protected.  This includes, where applicable, the immediate pension, early departure 
payments and lump sums.  These benefits will remain payable at the time they were 
expected to be paid, linked to your final pensionable pay/rank at the point of leaving the 
services, not the salary and rank at the time of transfer to the new scheme.  (See DIN 
2012DIN01-063 and DIN 2012DIN01-0175 on the Defence Intranet for more information and examples.)</p>

<h3 id="i-am-in-a-different-pension-scheme-what-about-me">I am in a different pension scheme, what about me?</h3>
<p>Accrued rights for the pension schemes covering the non-regular permanent staff, full time 
reserve service 1997 and reserve forces are explained in DIN 2012DIN01-0175 (available 
on the Defence Intranet). Accrued rights for the Gurkha pension scheme will be published 
later in the year. The Gibraltar Regiment pension scheme is subject to review and further 
details will be published in due course.  </p>

<h3 id="as-a-member-of-afps-75-what-about-my-accrued-rights">As a member of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 what about my accrued rights?</h3>

<p>Yes. If you are currently a member of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 then you have accrued rights to the rules of 
that scheme, so you will be able to apply for resettlement or life commutation for the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 
portion of your pension (see DIN 2012DIN01-0175 on the Defence Intranet).</p>

<h3 id="does-the-the-new-scheme-affect-resettlement-grants-sometimes-referred-to-as-half-pensions">Does the the new scheme affect resettlement grants (sometimes referred to as ‘half pensions’)?</h3>

<p>No. It is true that some of the booklets for the pension current schemes make reference to 
resettlement grants but in reality the 2 packages are unrelated.  The 9 years’ service (for 
officers in <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75) and 12 years’ service (for other ranks in <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 and all ranks who are 
members of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05). Resettlement grants are not being reviewed as part of the changes to the 
new pension scheme. </p>

<h3 id="i-get-a-pension-supplement--will-this-be-an-accrued-right">I get a pension supplement – will this be an accrued right?</h3>
<p>Yes. See DIN 2012DIN01-0175 on the Defence Intranet.</p>

<h3 id="an-updated-pension-scheme-was-introduced-in-2005---why-change-it-again">An updated pension scheme was introduced in 2005 -– why change it again?</h3>

<p>Public service pensions are becoming increasingly unaffordable as people are living longer (in 
1970 the life expectancy of a 60 year old was a further 18 years, this has risen to 28 years).
The cost of public service pensions has risen by more than a third over the past 10 years to 
£32 billion in 2008/2009.  Change has to be introduced to ensure public service pensions, 
including Armed Forces’ pensions, will be affordable and sustainable in the long term: fair to 
both existing service personnel and future generations, as well as for taxpayers who ultimately meet the costs.</p>

<h3 id="didnt-afps-05-address-the-affordability-issue">Didn’t <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 address the affordability issue?</h3>
<p>The move to <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05, in 2005, was not driven by a need to reduce costs but intended to 
bring the previous main pension scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75) up to date with changes to society and the 
law (for example <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 moved officers and other ranks onto common pension terms).  </p>

<h3 id="with-a-shorter-life-expectancy-dont-we-receive-our-pension-for-a-shorter-time">With a shorter life expectancy don’t we receive our pension for a shorter time?</h3>

<p>The opposite is true.  Predicting life expectancy is complex and depends on a number of factors but in general those who have been members of the Armed Forces tend to live a little longer than their civilian counterparts: 
• A UK male who was aged 60 in 2010 would generally have a life expectancy of 86 
years and a similar female would have a life expectancy of 88 years. <br>
• A retired male officer who was aged 60 in 2010 would have a life expectancy of 90 and 
a similar female would have a life expectancy of 92. 
• A retired male other rank who was aged 60 would have a life expectancy of 87 and a 
similar female would have a life expectancy of 90. <br>
Increases in life expectancy are likely to continue.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-just-change-it-for-those-joining-the-armed-forces-after-2015">Why not just change it for those joining the Armed Forces after 2015?</h3>
<p>Government policy is that the new public service pension schemes apply to all personnel from 
2015 unless they are covered by transitional protection.  There is a need to constrain pension 
costs and restricting the changes only to those who join the new scheme will not deliver the 
required reductions in spend.   </p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-legal-framework-for-closing-existing-armed-forces-pension-schemes">What is the legal framework for closing existing Armed Forces pension schemes?</h3>
<p>The government introduced a Public Service Pensions Bill in September 2012 to replace 
existing schemes with new public service schemes, to be in place from 2015.  </p>

<h3 id="what-was-the-hutton-review">What was the ‘Hutton Review’?</h3>
<p>In 2010 the government invited Lord Hutton of Furness (former Secretary of State for 
Defence, and former Minister for Work and Pensions) to conduct a review of public service 
pensions, including the Armed Forces’ pension schemes.  The Independent Public Service 
Pensions Commission (<abbr title="Independent Public Service Pensions Commission">IPSPC</abbr>) final report was published in March 2011.  It set out the case 
for change and made 27 recommendations to the government for the future management of 
public service pensions. The government accepted Lord Hutton’s recommendations as the 
basis for discussion.  Lord Hutton made it clear that a distinction should be drawn between the 
Armed Forces (and other uniformed services – the police and firefighters) from others in the 
public services due to the unique nature of their service. The government accepted this.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-my-new-pension-look-like">What will my new pension look like?</h3>
<p>You should read the Outline Scheme Design (<abbr title="Outline Scheme Design">OSD</abbr>) document for the new 
Armed Forces Pension Scheme which <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> published on 31 July 2012 (included in this detailed guide). Additionally, a short explanatory video has been produced to accompany the <abbr title="Outline Scheme Design">OSD</abbr> document.  Accrued rights to existing pension benefits earned prior to the introduction 
of the new scheme are discussed above. You should also read the final agreement document which was published at the same time that the final scheme agreement was announced in Parliament on 16 September 2012. Accrued rights to existing pension benefits earned prior to the introduction of the new scheme are also discussed above.  </p>

<h3 id="how-soon-will-i-start-feeling-the-affects-of-the-new-scheme">How soon will I start feeling the affects of the new scheme?</h3>
<p>Unless you are covered by transitional protection you will be automatically enrolled in the new scheme in 2015.  Your accrued rights to your existing scheme are fully protected and current serving personnel will not feel the full effects of the new scheme.  The earliest the full effects will be felt is 2035 (ie. those who join the Armed Forces after 2015 and leave at the new scheme’s <abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr> point after 20 years’ service.  </p>

<h3 id="will-the-career-average-earnings-scheme-reflect-my-service-prior-to-2015">Will the career average earnings scheme reflect my service prior to 2015?</h3>
<p>No. The new scheme won’t start until April 2015 so the first year’s pensionable salary to be 
taken into account for your new pension will be for the tax year 2015-2016.  Therefore, almost 
all currently serving personnel will start their career average earnings pension scheme on the 
highest salary which they will have earned in their career up to that point. </p>

<h3 id="will-my-service-under-current-schemes-count-towards-the-new-edp">Will my service under current schemes count towards the new <abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr>?</h3>

<p>Under the new scheme pensionable service will be counted from your first day of paid service, including any service prior to transfer to the new scheme.  For example, if you joined the 
Armed Forces in 2000, you would have accrued 15 years of service at the point of transition to 
the new scheme (April 2015) then you will only have to serve another 5 years to qualify for an 
<abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr> under the new scheme.  This is particularly good news for current members of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 
because, for the first time, your service prior to age 18 (for other ranks) and age 21 (for 
officers) will be count towards your <abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr> qualification.</p>

<h3 id="will-my-pension-still-be-worth-having-when-compared-to-other-public-service-pensions">Will my pension still be worth having when compared to other public service pensions?</h3>
<p>Although current costs are becoming increasingly unsustainable in the main, due to 
increasing life expectancy, the government has confirmed that public service pensions will 
remain among the best available.  <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is committed to ensuring the new Armed Forces 
Pension Scheme remains among the best of these schemes.  The new scheme will remain a 
defined benefit scheme, which means it will keep a guaranteed level of pension – calculated 
as a fraction of your salary, not an uncertain amount based on investment returns.  The 
pension scheme will also continue to provide valuable additional benefits for you and your 
family such as ill-health pensions and payments after your death.  </p>

<h3 id="how-much-will-my-new-pension-be-worth">How much will my new pension be worth?</h3>
<p>The actual reduction for individuals will vary considerably with individual circumstances.  It 
would be reasonable to say that the average service person with 9 years’ service will be no 
worse off under the new scheme.  Junior service personnel will be slightly better off under the 
new scheme, while more senior service personnel will be slightly worse off. </p>

<h3 id="will-average-earnings-rather-than-cpi-maintain-my-pensions-spending-power">Will average earnings, rather than CPI, maintain my pension’s spending power?</h3>

<p>Building a pension is a long term process.  The UK economy is in an unprecedented 
period of change; no one can forecast which index will be greater in the medium to long term.<br>
Between 1990 and 2010, average earnings outpaced the CPI for 18 of those 20 years.<br>
Taking this into account, the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission, the 
Government Actuary’s Department and <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> all  consider that, in the long term, average 
earnings will provide the best level of pension indexation for service personnel. </p>

<h3 id="my-current-terms-of-service-mean-i-will-have-to-exit-the-armed-forces-before-i-qualify-for-the-edp-under-the-new-scheme">My current terms of service mean I will have to exit the Armed Forces before I qualify for the <abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr> under the new scheme.</h3>

<p>The three services are already looking at future <abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr> and, as a priority, transitional 
arrangements to the new scheme for existing personnel to examine the potential to extend 
<abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr> to enable service personnel to serve to the new <abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr> threshold.  </p>

<h3 id="my-service-promotes-more-slowly-than-others-wont-a-career-average-earnings-pension-disadvantage-me">My service promotes more slowly than others. Won’t a career average earnings pension disadvantage me?</h3>

<p>It is a military truism that there will always be someone whom you perceive to be better off 
than yourself.  You will often find that some  trades/branches promote more slowly at some 
ranks, but then catch up or even overtake later.  The single services recognise this as a 
<abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr> issue.  However, even in the future some trades/branches will require longer 
training or promotion patterns to support operational effectiveness. </p>

<h3 id="im-on-an-ftrs-contract-and-my-current-pension-is-abated-will-this-stop">I’m on an <abbr title="Full Time Reserve Service">FTRS</abbr> contract and my current pension is abated. Will this stop?</h3>

<p>Abatement of pension benefits will be abolished under the new scheme.  However, that will not 
affect the abatement of your current pension, which was earned under a previous scheme.<br>
We have established accrued rights to the pension benefits which service personnel have 
(and are) earning under their current schemes; those rights include a commitment from the 
government to adhere to the rules of those schemes, including abatement rules.  So while the 
change to the new scheme will not affect your current abatement, it will stop abatement of any 
pension you earn under the new scheme, and it will benefit the service person who follows 
you. </p>

<h3 id="isnt-my-salary-abated-by-the-afprb-to-pay-for-my-pension">Isn’t my salary abated by the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pay Review Body">AFPRB</abbr> to pay for my pension?</h3>

<p>You do not make a direct contribution towards your pension benefit and this will continue in the new scheme.  Every 5 years or so the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pay Review Body">AFPRB</abbr>) 
compares the value of Armed Forces pensions with that of civilian occupational pension 
schemes; this relative comparison is taken into account during the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pay Review Body">AFPRB</abbr>’s assessment of 
broad pay comparability.  Nothing is actually deducted from military pay (no ‘abatement’ or 
‘adjustment’ is made), but the relative value is included as part of pay comparability 
considerations.  So while the pension is used as one of the comparators between civilian and 
military, it is one of several factors in a complex calculation and there is no direct reduction in the service salary because of this comparison.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Armed Forces Pay Review Body">AFPRB</abbr> has been kept fully informed of the changes to military pensions and will take this 
into account when making its pay recommendations in future. </p>

<p>During the consultation 71% of respondents said they intended to use their <abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr> 
towards house purchase.  Work is being conducted separately through the New Employment 
Model programme to explore further ways of assisting service personnel with home 
ownership. Service personnel will be consulted during policy development and fully informed once the policy is settled.  </p>

<h3 id="further-information-1">Further information</h3>

<p>The Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme team leads on the strategic policy development of the new scheme. The <abbr title="Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme">FAFPS</abbr> team is led by and includes officers from all three services, all of whom have experience in pay and pensions at <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> level. If you think the team has overlooked a policy issue, you can email them via the <abbr title="Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme">FAFPS</abbr> group mailbox . However, the <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> should be the first port of call for individual queries.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Future Armed Forces Pension Scheme">FAFPS</abbr> team are not financially accredited to give specific individual advice; should you feel this is what you need, you should contact an independent financial adviser. The Services Insurance and Investment Advisory Panel (SIIAP) can give specialist independent financial advice to service personnel (see SIIAP in External links).</p>

<p>The Forces Pension Society (<abbr title="Forces Pension Society">FPS</abbr>) is an independent organisation that can advise service personnel on their pensions (see <abbr title="Forces Pension Society">FPS</abbr> in External links).</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The new Armed Forces pension will remain among the very best pension schemes available. It will remain a defined benefit scheme, which means it will keep a guaranteed level of pension - calculated as a fraction of a service person’s salary, not an uncertain amount based on investment returns. It will also continue to provide valuable benefits, such as ill-health and dependents’ pensions. The service chiefs have endorsed the new scheme as one which meets the Armed Forces’ recruitment and retention needs, while striking a fair balance between providing proper recognition of the unique commitment made by members of the Armed Forces and the requirement for an affordable and sustainable scheme that is fair to the taxpayer.</p>

<p>The Forces Pension Society says: “I believe it is probably the best proposal out of all the public sector scheme choices in terms of a complete package. … in overall terms I am 100% sure that the scheme on offer is as good as the Armed Forces could have hoped for…’ (see Pathfinder magazine in External links).</p>

<h2 id="how-to-transfer-benefits-in-and-out-of-the-armed-forces-pension-schemes">How to transfer benefits in and out of the Armed Forces Pension Schemes</h2>

<h3 id="transfer-factors">Transfer factors</h3>

<p>The factors for all types of transfer are currently being updated.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-transfer">Types of Transfer</h3>

<p>There are two types of transfers ‘Club Transfers’ and ‘Non Club Transfers’’:</p>

<h4 id="a-club-transfer">A “club” transfer</h4>

<p>A club transfer takes place when the previous or new arrangement is a member of the public sector transfer club and under this transfer you would receive a service credit of equivalent value to that built up in the previous scheme, regardless of any change in salary.</p>

<h4 id="a-non-club-transfer">A “non-club” transfer</h4>

<p>A non-club transfer takes place if the previous or new scheme is not a member of the public sector transfer club and you would receive a lower service credit under these arrangements. </p>

<h3 id="what-does-transferring-pension-benefits-mean">What does Transferring Pension Benefits Mean?</h3>

<h4 id="transfers-in">Transfers In</h4>

<p>Transferring pension benefits into <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 </p>

<p>If you are a member of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 then you are now no longer able to transfer any pension benefits into the scheme. This is because there is a time limit of undertaking this option - within one year of taking up employment - and <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 has been closed to new entrants from 5 Apr 05.</p>

<p>Transferring pension benefits into <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05</p>

<p>If you are a member of Armed Forces Pensions Scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>) 05 and have built up pension benefits elsewhere before joining the Armed Forces you have the option to transfer in the value of your other benefits to receive a service credit in <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05.</p>

<p>If you are a member of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 you can undertake a “club” transfer within one year of taking up employment and “non-club” transfers before the beginning of your final year of service before your pension is due.</p>

<h4 id="transfers-out">Transfers Out</h4>

<p>If you leave <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 or <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 without receiving immediate pension benefits (including leaving with an Early Departure Payment (<abbr title="Early Departure Payment">EDP</abbr>) under <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05) you have the option to transfer the value of your preserved pension benefits to another pension arrangement.</p>

<p>Transferring Benefits Out of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 75 or <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05</p>

<p>If you leave the Armed Forces with a preserved pension and take up new employment where an occupational pension scheme is available, you can transfer your preserved <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> benefits into that scheme.</p>

<p>You can apply for a transfer at any time up to one year before your benefits become payable or up to six months after leaving the Armed Forces, if that is later, provided you left the Armed Forces on or after 1 Jan 86. However, the receiving scheme may also impose its own time limits for transfers in.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-the-transfer-value-calculated">How is the transfer value calculated?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> use factor tables to determine the amount of reckonable service to be credited. These tables relate to the sex and age of the individual. </p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-arrange-a-transfer-in-of-benefits">What do I need to do to arrange a transfer in of benefits?</h3>

<p>Before you apply to Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>) for a transfer you need to obtain details of the amount of your transfer value from your previous pension scheme, and then an estimate from <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> of the additional reckonable service that this will buy in your new scheme. If you decide to go ahead with the transfer, you should make your application to <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> in writing (see address below).</p>

<p>You must be serving in the Armed Forces to be eligible to transfer in and once you have committed yourself to a transfer from your previous pension scheme, you cannot change your mind and you will have given up forever your rights and those of your dependants under the previous schemes.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-arrange-a-transfer-out-of-benefits">What do I need to do to arrange a transfer out of benefits?</h3>

<p>If you leave the Armed Forces to take up new employment where an occupational pension scheme is available, you can transfer your preserved pension from the Armed Forces Pension Scheme into that scheme.  Alternatively you can transfer to a personal pension scheme.  Before you apply for a transfer please ensure that you have considered all the issues carefully and the time limits that may apply (see the Transferring Benefits booklet under Related Documents for details).  If you then decide to go ahead with the transfer, you should make your application to <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> in writing (see address below).</p>

<p>Once you have committed yourself to a transfer from the Armed Forces Pension Scheme and the transfer of funds has been completed, you cannot change your mind and you will have given up forever your rights and those of your dependants under the Armed Forces Pension schemes.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-get-more-information">Where can I get more information?</h3>

<p>The booklet Transferring Benefits on the right hand side under Related Documents provides more information and points out some of the issues you should consider before undertaking any transfer of benefits.

<h3 id="the-review-of-the-afcs">The Review of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Compensation Scheme">AFCS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The Scheme was reviewed under the independent chairmanship of former Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral the Lord Boyce.  The Review report, published in February 2010, found that the Scheme was fundamentally sound, but that adjustments were required in some areas.  </p>

<h3 id="implementing-the-changes">Implementing the Changes</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> made a commitment to implement all recommendations from the Review and this was completed in revised legislation in February 2011 - see below.</p>

<h3 id="excavation-of-crashed-military-aircraft-within-the-united-kingdom">Excavation of crashed military aircraft within the United Kingdom</h3>

<p>All military aircraft crash sites in the United Kingdom (UK), its territorial waters, or British aircraft in international waters, are controlled sites under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.  It is an offence under this act to tamper with, damage, move or unearth any items at such sites, unless the Ministry of Defence has issued a licence authorizing such activity. As such, anyone wishing to recover a military aircraft, or excavate a military aircraft crash site in the UK is required to obtain a licence from the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (<abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>), part of the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="licence-application-procedure">Licence Application Procedure</h3>

<p>Before a licence can be issued, applicants are required to research and supply to the Joint Casualty &amp; Compassionate Centre all relevant information on the aircraft they wish to recover including: location of crash site and the fate of the crew. Further guidance on obtaining a licence and copies of the application forms are contained in the booklet “<a href="/government/publications/licensing-of-aviation-archaeology" title="application form and guidance notes for excavating UK military crash sites">Crashed Military Aircraft of Historical Interest – Notes for Guidance of Recovery Groups</a>” or supplied on request by the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre</p>

<p>On receipt of a licence application, the Joint Casualty &amp; Compassionate Centre checks the information supplied against official records held in the Ministry of Defence archives, Air Historical Branch, Commonwealth War Graves Commission and where appropriate with the German or American authorities. These enquiries may take several months to complete; as such applicants should apply for a licence at least 3 month before they intend to commence work.</p>

<p>A licence is required to excavate any military aircraft crash site in the United Kingdom, irrespective whether the aircraft was in the service of the British, American, German or other nation’s armed forces.</p>

<p>A licence will not be issued if human remains are likely to be found at the site.</p>

<p>A licence cannot be issued if significant amounts of unexploded ordnance (bombs) are believed to be present at the site.</p>

<p>All applications for a licence require the written support of the landowner to the excavation taking place.</p>

<p>Additional requirements may have to be met, before a licence is issued to excavate a crash site in a National Park or designated Site of Special Scientific Interest.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence reserves the right to deploy its representatives to witness any excavations approved under the Protection of Military Remains Act.</p>

<p>Outside the United Kingdom, International or British territorial waters, the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 does not apply.  Excavations of crash sites of British aircraft are be subject to the laws of the country concerned. However, Ministry of Defence policy is to discourage disturbance of such sites unless necessary in respect of host Government approved activities, such as land reclamation or construction.</p>

<h3 id="local-government-requirements">Local Government Requirements</h3>

<p>Local Councils may impose additional requirements or limitations in respect of archaeological activity within their area of jurisdiction, particularly if the crash site is in an area where other historical artefacts may be disturbed.  Applicants for a licence under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 should therefore check with the Council or local Sites and Monuments Records Officer in advance, or at the same time, as applying for a licence from the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<h3 id="ownership-of-recovered-items">Ownership of Recovered Items</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the issuing of a licence, all items recovered remain the property of the Crown. This includes items recovered from crashed British aircraft outside the UK (for which a licence is not required). Excavations are licensed on the understanding that the Ministry of Defence may require the licensee to surrender all items recovered to the Department without compensation.</p>

<p>On expiry of the licence, or completion of the excavation if earlier, Licensees are required to file a report to the Joint Casualty &amp; Compassionate Centre, listing all items found and if appropriate request transfer of ownership. Transfer of ownership is not guaranteed, but in practice ownership of most items recovered, including parts of the aircraft may be transferred to the licensee. However, the following items have to be surrendered to the Ministry of Defence:</p>

<ul>
<li>all personal items belonging to the crew (which will be returned to the NOK or crewmember if still alive)</li>
  <li>all official documents / records</li>
  <li>items assessed as being of historical interest (The Ministry of Defence seeks the views of the Royal Air Force Museum on the historical value of items recovered) </li>
</ul>
<p>Should the Ministry of Defence learn that not all items recovered have been declared, or items have been recovered or disposed of contrary to the terms of the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, the licensee or individual concerned will be liable to prosecution.</p>

<p>If you have any enquiries on the licensing of military aircraft excavations within the United Kingdom, not answered by the advice above, please contact the Commemorations &amp; Licensing team at the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="casualty-reporting">Casualty Reporting</h2>

<p>Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (<abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>)</p>

<p>All casualty reports are made by an electronic Notification of Casualty (<abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr>) report incorporated within the Joint Personnel Administration (<abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr>) system, to the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (<abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> distributes the <abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr> and tasks the Notifying Authority to ensure that the nominated Emergency Contact and, where applicable, the Next of Kin are informed. The <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> may be able to authorise the travel of Next of Kin to the bedside of a casualty under the Dangerously Ill Forwarding of Relatives (<abbr title="Dangerously Ill Forwarding of Relatives">DILFOR</abbr>) scheme in appropriate circumstances.</p>

<p>All three Services now use the new e-<abbr title="Notification of Casualty">NOTICAS</abbr> report on <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr> and the new system has as been a major step forward in improving reporting capability through electronic messaging. However, should <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr> be unavailable, for example on some deployed operations, or temporary local system failure, then the signal format and fax may still be used.</p>

<p>It is also very important that the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> is kept informed of any changes to casualty state or location so that the Emergency Contact/Next of Kin and the chain of command can be kept informed of the latest situation.</p>

<h2 id="compassionate-casework">Compassionate Casework</h2>

<p>Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre</p>

<p>The Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (<abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>) also provides a compassionate casework service world-wide. If circumstances should arise, while a Service person is overseas, families and relatives can apply for her/his return on compassionate grounds - for example in the event of a death in the family, serious illness or serious family crisis.</p>

<p>Details are provided on Form <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr> P001 ‘Compassionate Leave Travel from Overseas’. This small credit-card sized form is designed to be issued to personnel deploying on operations so that they may give it to their families and relatives. It provides advice on how to get help in the event of a problem. Personnel are issued with copies of the form before proceeding overseas. </p>

<p>NB:  <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr> P001 has recently been revised to provide a “write-on strip” for Service Personnel to write their Service Number on the card in order to assist their families and relatives should they need to contact the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Granting of compassionate leave is a matter for the individual’s Commanding Officer, but working closely with Service welfare organisations the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> will investigate any reported case and categorise the case for travel and assistance. </p>

<p>In the most serious cases, Category A, the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> will authorise the return of an individual by the fastest possible means and will work closely with the Defence Transport and Movements Agency Compassionate Travel Cell to achieve that aim. Less serious cases may be allocated a lower priority.</p>

<h2 id="joint-casualty-and-compassionate-centre-jccc">Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (<abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (<abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>) provides a focal point for casualty administration and notification and requests for compassionate travel (for those personnel serving overseas) in respect of members of the British armed forces.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>, part of the Service Personnel &amp; Veterans Agency is based at Imjin Barracks, Innsworth in Gloucestershire and manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> can be contacted at any time of the day or night by any of the following means:</p>

<h2 id="death-in-service">Death in Service</h2>

<h3 id="jccc"><abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr></h3>

<p>Should personnel die in military service, the Casualty reporting requirements are the same as other casualty events in the first instance. The <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> will then instigate the appropriate follow-on actions, which may include repatriation of the deceased to the UK, registration of the death and marking of the grave.</p>

<p>In association with our <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> colleagues at Norcross, we work closely with the Notifying Authority, the Casualty Notification Officer (CNO) and the Visiting Officer (VO) to ensure that families are supported throughout such difficult occasions. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> is the single point of contact for bereaved families on all financial matters relating to Service in the Armed Forces and operates a Freephone Helpline on 0800 169 22 77.  The Helpline can offer advice on pension, compensation, accommodation, pay and allowance issues.   However, VO’s or families seeking specialist advice on repatriation, funeral entitlements, the marking of graves or estate issues should contact the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> direct.  </p>

<h3 id="estates-casework">Estates Casework</h3>

<p>Following a death in service, the Deceased Estates staff of the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> will authorise the release of any personal effects found on military property to the next of kin or executor, and is responsible for notifying the executor of any monies due to the Estate from the MoD (such as balance of pay / death in service grant). Payment is made to the Executor once the necessary legal authority has been obtained.</p>

<p>The team also makes payments to the Estate of ex service personnel in respect of a preserved pension and will investigate and may grant exemptions from Inheritance Tax on an Estate, under S154 of the Inheritance Tax Act, where death arises during or, in the view of Service medical authorities, is proved to have been hastened by, active service against an enemy, or other service of a war like nature. IHT exemptions on the estates of those who die whilst actually serving in the armed forces, where the qualifying criteria of the legislation is met, will be granted automatically by the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>. However, exemptions on the estates of veterans have to be applied for by the NOK / executor after the death of the individual.</p>

<p>Further details are provided on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.veterans-uk.info/pensions/inheritance.html">Veterans UK Website</a></p>

<h3 id="funerals-and-graves">Funerals and graves</h3>

<p>Where an individual dies whilst in paid military service, they are entitled to either a service funded or private funeral.  With a service funeral, the Unit will pay the majority of the undertakers bill, whilst the family are responsible for settling the bill following a private funeral. In both cases the NOK, or executor, will receive a £1,000 funeral expenses grant from the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> to help meet any non-admissible funeral expenses and to help with costs to attend any memorial / remembrance service or unit homecoming parade. For those families who choose to organise a private funeral, the MoD will also pay a second grant (of up to £3215) on production of a receipted funeral bill.  </p>

<p>Where a Service funeral is held, the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> will offer to provide a military pattern headstone, urn plot marker (<abbr title="urn plot marker">UPM</abbr>), or entry in a Book of Remembrance, at public expense, as a memorial to the deceased.  Service headstones (not <abbr title="urn plot marker">UPM</abbr>) will be maintained in perpetuity (subject to certain conditions) under arrangements put in place by the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> (for non war graves) or the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (War Graves).</p>

<p>Full details of the regulations pertaining to headstones and markers are available at Volume 2 Chapter 3 of JSP 751. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> also provides details of all those who die in military service, to the Trustees of Armed Forces Memorial.  This memorial, located in the National Memorial Arboretum, at Alrewas, in Staffordshire, commemorates service personnel who have died whilst on duty, or as the result of terrorist activity, since 1 January 1948.  The decision as to which names appear on the memorial is a matter for the Trustees and not the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr>.  Further information on the Armed Forces Memorial and a roll of honour listing all those who have died in military service (on or off duty) since 1 January 1948 may be obtained via  <a rel="external" href="http://www.veterans-uk.info/afm/index.htm">Veterans site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jccc-post-death-administration">
<abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> Post Death Administration</h2>

<p>The work of the Post Death Administration section is primarily focussed on assisting bereaved families and the military personnel and veterans welfare staff supporting them in the immediate aftermath of any recent death in military service (See Death in Service section) but they also have a key role to perform in relation to work arising from fatalities from other conflicts during the past century.</p>

<h3 id="commemorations--licensing">Commemorations &amp; Licensing</h3>

<p>A small team answers enquires relating to individual military fatalities outside the recent past and co-ordinates investigations following the discovery of human remains of British service personnel killed in the First and Second World Wars,. This fascinating work involves attempts to identify the casualty and trace their next of kin or descendants. In accordance with the policy in force at the time of death, the MoD does not repatriate the bodies of those who died prior to the mid 1960’s but will arrange an appropriate interment or military funeral in the country concerned and where identities can be established will fund two close relatives to attend the service. </p>

<p>The Commemorations Team will also;</p>

<p>Issues licenses (on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence) under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, to groups wishing to carry out archaeological investigations at military aircraft (British, American or German) crash sites in the UK. (See link to Aviation Archaeology page).</p>

<p>Advise the CWGC on the validity of claims from members of the public suggesting identities for bodies buried as “Unknown Soldiers, Sailors or Airmen”. Identities will only be confirmed and the headstone on the grave changed where the identity can be established using “clear and convincing” evidence which can be validated by the MoD.</p>

<h2 id="jpac-enquiry-centre">
<abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration Centre">JPAC</abbr> Enquiry Centre</h2>

<p><abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration Centre">JPAC</abbr> acts as first point of contact for any query from serving personnel</p>

<p>Telephone calls to the <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration Centre">JPAC</abbr> Enquiry Centre will be answered by a an automated message and will ask the caller to select one of four options:</p>

<ul>
<li>pensions</li>
  <li>medals</li>
  <li>IT enquiries and password resets</li>
  <li>pay, personnel and records of service &amp; ID Cards  </li>
</ul>
<p>(Additional options may be added for specific incidents/scenarios)</p>

<p>Having selected an option the caller will be routed to an appropriate agent who will ask what the query/problem is; carry out an identification and verification process and take appropriate further action.</p>

<h2 id="major-incident-centre">Major Incident Centre</h2>

<p>In the event of a major casualty incident involving members of the Armed Forces and/or civilian personnel deployed on operations, the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> will activate a Major Incident Centre, manned initially by Service Personnel &amp; Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>) personnel and subsequently reinforced, if necessary, by Service personnel.</p>

<p>Activation will be notified by IMMEDIATE signal and when operational, a ‘Lo-Call 0845’ telephone number will be publicised for families and relatives to make enquiries.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that in the early phases of a major incident information will be limited and the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> will be concentrating its efforts on informing Emergency Contacts/Next of Kin about those who may have been injured.</p>

<h2 id="estates-of-deceased-service-personnel---unpaid-estates">Estates of Deceased Service Personnel - Unpaid Estates</h2>

<p>The Deceased Estates Office of the <abbr title="Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre">JCCC</abbr> is responsible for making payments from the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to the estate of deceased service personnel, as well as those who die in retirement, whilst holding preserved pension rights, arising from military service after 1975, where there is no eligible dependant to whom the pension can be paid.</p>

<p>In most cases, we are able to contact and make a payment to the executor of the estate, or the next of kin within a few months of the individual’s death. However, occasionally, despite our best efforts, we are unable to trace the appropriate relative, particularly in those cases where the individual died many years after being discharged or retiring from the armed forces with a preserved pension.</p>

<p>The amounts due to the estate in such cases are often relatively small, but can total several thousand pounds. Ultimately, if an estate exceeds £5,000 in value, and no blood relatives can be identified, the money will pass to the Crown as ‘Bona Vacantia’.</p>

<p>As at 31 July 2012, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> held funds due to the estates of the following personnel, all of whom died more than 12 months ago. (This list will be updated by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> from time to time).</p>
