<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Improved plant varieties and good quality seeds are essential for safe, reliable and efficient crop and food production.</p>

<p>As an incentive for plant breeding, breeders of any species of plant - whether agricultural, horticultural or ornamental - can apply for Plant Breeders’ Rights (<abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>). These give the breeder legal rights in the UK over the varieties they have developed.</p>

<p>The Plant Variety Rights Office, which is part of the Food and Environment Research Agency, administers PBRs in the UK.</p>

<p>Alternatively, plant breeders can make a single application for protection throughout the 27 member states of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to the Community Plant Variety Office, which has offices in France.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-plant-breeders-rights">What are Plant Breeders’ Rights?</h2>

<p><abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> in the UK are administered through the Plant Varieties Act 1997. They give breeders legal rights over any new varieties of plants they have developed and allow them to charge royalties for using these ‘protected’ varieties. This provides a means for breeding companies to fund their work.</p>

<p>If you hold <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> this will mean that no-one else, unless specifically authorised, can use your plant species for:</p>

<ul>
<li>production or reproduction</li>
  <li>selling or offering for sale</li>
  <li>conditioning for the purpose of propagation</li>
  <li>exporting or importing</li>
  <li>stocking for any of the above purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>These rights only apply if the plants are being used for commercial purposes - they do not apply to any act done for private and non-commercial purposes, for experimental purposes or for the purpose of breeding another variety.</p>

<p>All applications and enquiries should be made to the Plant Variety Rights Office (<abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr>) at:</p>

<p><abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr><br>
Whitehouse Lane<br>
Huntingdon Road<br>
Cambridge<br>
CB3 OLF</p>

<p>You can also call the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr> helpline on 01223 342 379, or email them at <a href="mailto:pvs.helpdesk@fera.gsi.gov.uk">pvs.helpdesk@fera.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> is valid for 25 years, except for trees, vines or potato varieties which will be protected for 30 years.</p>

<p>You may give up your rights at any time and rights may be terminated if the variety no longer fulfils its criteria. </p>

<h3 id="what-rights-are-there-for-dependent-varieties">What rights are there for dependent varieties?</h3>

<p>You will also have <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> in respect of any variety which is ‘dependent on’ your protected variety.</p>

<p>This applies to varieties that require the repeated use of your protected variety (such as hybrids), or those which are ‘essentially derived’ from it - meaning that they were bred from it and retain its fundamental characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="application-procedure-and-fees">Application procedure and fees</h2>

<p>When making an application for <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> you must submit the following to the Plant Variety Rights Office:</p>

<ul>
<li>an application form</li>
  <li>a completed technical questionnaire for the correct species of the plant variety</li>
  <li>for ornamental species - a colour photograph of the representative features of the variety</li>
</ul>
<p>All applications and documents must be in English or have an English translation.</p>

<p>When making payments you must also submit an RAS 1 or RAS 2 form which must be sent to <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr>:</p>

<p><abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr><br>
Sand Hutton<br>
York<br>
YO41 1LZ</p>

<p>You can contact the <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> helpline on 01904 462 000, or fax them on 01904 462111.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/feesForms/plantBreedersRights.cfm">find all the forms and questionnaires on the <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fees">Fees</h3>

<p>You must pay an administration fee for each application made. Additionally, other fees payable may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a ‘distinct, uniform and stable’ (<abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable">DUS</abbr>) test fee and a reference variety fee, both payable for each year of testing</li>
  <li>the purchase price of a testing report from another country, when the report is available</li>
</ul>
<p>For details of the current application fees, <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantVarieties/nationalListing/documents/fees2011.pdf">download a table of fees for National Listing (PDF, 34K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-applications-are-processed">How applications are processed</h3>

<p>The candidate variety will be <abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable">DUS</abbr> tested and considered by experts to check whether all the requirements have been met. Proposed decisions will be announced through the UK National Lists and Seeds Committee on behalf of the Controller of Plant Variety Rights. </p>

<p>Announcements of a proposal to grant rights will be published in the Plant Varieties and Seeds Gazette. The announcement gives any person who can show that he or she has an interest in the decision the right to make written representations or to request a hearing in person against the proposed decision. A period of 18 days is normally allowed for such purposes. If none are received and providing all information has been submitted and fees paid a UK Grant of Rights will be issued.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> will be enforceable at any point after it is granted. However, you are entitled to reasonable compensation if your rights are infringed at any time after receipt of the application has been published in the Gazette.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-apply-for-plant-breeders-rights">Who can apply for Plant Breeders’ Rights?</h2>

<p>You can apply for <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> if you have bred, discovered or developed the plant variety in question, or if you have been designated by the breeder as the successor in title.</p>

<p>However, if you have bred, discovered or developed the plant as part of your normal employment, your employer is entitled to the rights and you are not - unless you have an agreement in place that allows you to apply for <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> in your name.</p>

<h3 id="agents">Agents</h3>

<p><abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> can be applied for either in person or through an agent. Applicants from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must give an address for an agent within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. If you decide to use an agent you must give the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr> written authorisation for the agent to act on your behalf. Likewise, if you are acting as an agent the breeder must give written proof that you are allowed to act for them.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/forms/documents/DEF-PVS11-FERA-0709.pdf">download an authorisation of agent form from the <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website (PDF, 519K)</a>.</p>

<p>If as a breeder you apply for your <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> through an agent you should be aware that all correspondence and requests for fees from <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr> will be sent to the agent. This means that although you hold the rights you will not receive any correspondence directly.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you act as an agent it is your responsibility to process any correspondence from <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr> and do all that is necessary to obtain and maintain the rights such as paying fees.</p>

<h2 id="criteria-for-a-plant-variety-to-obtain-plant-breeders-rights">Criteria for a plant variety to obtain Plant Breeders’ Rights</h2>

<p>Once you have applied for <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>, the Plant Variety Rights Office will ask you to send them material of the plant variety for distinctness, uniformity and stability (<abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable">DUS</abbr>) testing.</p>

<h3 id="distinctness">Distinctness</h3>

<p>A variety must have one or more major characteristics, which can be precisely described, that makes it different from any other variety ‘in common knowledge’. A variety is said to be ‘in common knowledge’ if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is, or has been, the subject of <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> in any country</li>
  <li>it is, or has been, entered in an official register of plant varieties in any country</li>
  <li>an application for <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> or entry in an official register is under consideration in any country</li>
</ul>
<p>A variety may also be in common knowledge if it is already in cultivation, has been exploited for commercial purposes, is held in a recognised reference collection or has a precise description in any publication.</p>

<h3 id="uniformity">Uniformity</h3>

<p>A variety must be sufficiently uniform in the characteristics which make it distinct, subject to normal and expected variation.</p>

<h3 id="stability">Stability</h3>

<p>To qualify for stability, the plant characteristics which make it distinct must remain unchanged after repeated propagation.</p>

<h3 id="novelty">Novelty</h3>

<p>A variety is said to be new if it has not been sold or otherwise exploited with the consent of the applicant:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the UK, earlier than one year before the date of application</li>
  <li>outside the UK, earlier than four years (six years in the case of trees or vines) before the date of application</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-organisations">Testing organisations</h3>

<p>Testing is carried out by approved organisations. They include the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in England and Wales, Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture and the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>For some species, testing is carried out by testing authorities in other European member states under bi-lateral agreements.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-do-the-tests-take">How long do the tests take?</h3>

<p>Usually <abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable">DUS</abbr> testing of ornamentals takes one year, herbage varieties four years, trees three years, and other species two years. This is just a guideline and may vary if there is difficulty in establishing distinctness.</p>

<p>For hybrid varieties tests may also need to be conducted on the parental lines.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantVarieties/nationalListing/dusTestingRequirements.cfm">Find information on the protocols for <abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable">DUS</abbr> testing of specific plant species on the <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="community-plant-variety-rights">Community Plant Variety Rights</h2>

<p>If you want to have protection for your plant variety throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you can apply to the Community Plant Variety Office (<abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office">CPVO</abbr>) for Community Plant Variety Rights (<abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.cpvo.europa.eu/main/en/home/filing-an-application/online-forms">find online application forms and technical questionnaires on the <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office">CPVO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>The offices of the <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office">CPVO</abbr> are located in France:</p>

<p><abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office">CPVO</abbr><br>
3 Boulevard Marechal Foch<br>
B.P. 10121<br>
FR - 49101 Angers Cedex 02<br>
France</p>

<p>You can also call the <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office">CPVO</abbr> helpline on +33 241 25 64 00 or e-mail them at <a href="mailto:cpvo@cpvo.europa.eu">cpvo@cpvo.europa.eu</a>.</p>

<p>The procedure for applying for <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr> is very similar to the procedure for applying for UK <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>). You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.cpvo.europa.eu/main/en">find guidance on all aspects of <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr> and which forms and fees to submit on the <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office">CPVO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Like <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>, once <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr> is granted it is valid for a maximum duration of 25 years, or 30 years for vine, trees and potatoes, provided that the annual fees are paid.</p>

<h3 id="cpvrand-pbr">
<abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr> and <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr> and UK <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> are separate and you cannot hold both simultaneously.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr> is granted for a variety which already has a national <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>, the national rights are suspended for the duration of the <abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights">CPVR</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="royalty-payments-on-farm-saved-seed">Royalty payments on farm-saved seed</h2>

<p>Holders of <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> are entitled to charge farmers if they use farm-saved seed (seed that they have harvested from crops they have grown themselves) of the protected variety. This applies to plant varieties of the following species:</p>

<ul>
<li>potatoes</li>
  <li>cereals - oats, barley, rice, canary grass, rye, triticale, wheat, durum wheat and spelt wheat</li>
  <li>fodder plants - chickpea milkvetch, yellow lupin, lucerne, field pea, berseem/Egyptian clover, Persian clover, field bean and common vetch</li>
  <li>oil and fibre plants - swede rape, turnip rape and linseed - with the exclusion of flax</li>
</ul>
<p>Farmers who use farm-saved seed should pay you a fair fee - which should be sensibly lower than the royalty charged on the sales of certified seed. Farmers are required by law to declare their use of farm-saved seed (<abbr title="Farm-saved Seed">FSS</abbr>) of eligible varieties to the British Society of Plant Breeders (<abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>), which is responsible for collecting <abbr title="Farm-saved Seed">FSS</abbr> payments. You can <a rel="external" href="http://returns.bspb.co.uk/">make your <abbr title="Farm-saved Seed">FSS</abbr> Declaration and arrange payment of royalties</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bspb.co.uk/fssd/introduction.html">find out about farm-saved seed payments on the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="apply-for-a-compulsory-licence">Apply for a compulsory licence</h2>

<p>For a two-year period after <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> are granted, the <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> holder is free to decide who they will grant licences to, and any other terms and conditions. After this time, compulsory licences may be granted.</p>

<p>Any person who has applied for a licence to use a protected species and feels that the <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> holder has unreasonably refused to grant the licence or has imposed unreasonable terms, can apply for a compulsory licence.</p>

<p>Compulsory licence applications are made to the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr>. A compulsory licence will not be granted by the Controller of Plant Variety Rights unless he is satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
<li>a licence is necessary to ensure the variety is available to the public at a reasonable price, is widely distributed, or quality is maintained</li>
  <li>the applicant is in a position to - and intends to - exploit the variety in a professional way</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-the-effect-of-a-compulsory-licence">What is the effect of a compulsory licence?</h3>

<p>The Controller may grant any licence that might have been granted by the holder of the <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>. The Controller can also extend, limit, vary or revoke a compulsory licence and impose terms and conditions.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply-for-a-compulsory-licence">How to apply for a compulsory licence</h3>

<p>You can get an application form from the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office">PVRO</abbr>.</p>

<p>All applications must be accompanied by the fee, which is currently £65. All forms should also be signed by a person with the authority to do this.</p>
