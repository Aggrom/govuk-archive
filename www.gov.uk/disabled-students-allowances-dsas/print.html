  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As a higher education student living in England, you can apply for a Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) if you have a:</p>

<ul>
<li>disability</li>
  <li>long-term health condition</li>
  <li>mental health condition</li>
  <li>specific learning difficulty such as dyslexia</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> are paid on top of student finance and you don’t have to pay them back. The amount you get depends on your individual needs and not on income.</p>


</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The amount of Disabled Students’ Allowances (<abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr>) you can get depends on your individual needs - not your household income. </p>

<p>You can get help with the costs of:</p>

<ul>
<li>specialist equipment, like computer software</li>
  <li>non-medical helpers, like a note-taker or reader</li>
  <li>extra travel costs you have to pay because of your disability</li>
  <li>other costs, like photocopying </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> don’t cover disability-related costs you’d have if you weren’t attending a course, or costs that any student might have.</p>
</div>

<h2>Your ‘needs assessment’</h2>

<p>Once your eligibility for <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> has been confirmed, Student Finance England will ask you to have a ‘needs assessment’ test to work out what help you need. </p>

<p>You shouldn’t book a needs assessment until Student Finance England ask you to. </p>

<p>The assessment is paid for through any <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> entitlement you may have.</p>

<p>After the assessment, you’ll get a report listing equipment and other support you can get for your course.</p>

<h2>Maximum amounts</h2>

<p>The figures below are the maximum you can get - most students get less than this. </p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Type of student</th>
      <th>Specialist equipment allowance</th>
      <th>Non-medical helper allowance</th>
      <th>General allowance</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Full-time</td>
      <td>Up to £5,161 for the whole course</td>
      <td>Up to £20,520 a year</td>
      <td>Up to £1,724 a year</td>
    </tr>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Postgraduate students can get a single allowance of up to £10,260.</p>
</div>

<h2>Part-time students</h2>

<p>If you’re a part-time student the ‘course intensity’ may affect how much <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowance">DSA</abbr> you get. Intensity means how long your course takes to complete each year compared to an equivalent full-time course. Your course must:</p>

<ul>
<li>last at least 1 year</li>
  <li>not last more than 4 times as long as the equivalent full-time course </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you start a course <strong>before</strong> 1 September 2012 your course must not last more than twice as long as the equivalent full-time course.</p>
</div>

<h2>How <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> are paid</h2>

<p>Money is paid directly to who provides the service or equipment or into your bank account.</p>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for Disabled Students’ Allowances (<abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr>) if you have a: </p>

<ul>
<li>disability or long-term health condition</li>
  <li>mental health condition </li>
  <li>specific learning difficulty like dyslexia or dyspraxia</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
<li>be an undergraduate or postgraduate student (including Open University or distance learning)</li>
  <li>have a condition that affects your ability to study </li>
  <li>qualify for student finance from Student Finance England</li>
  <li>be studying on a course that lasts at least a year</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who isn’t eligible</h2>

<p>You can’t get <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> from Student Finance England if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>an EU student</li>
  <li>eligible for an <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/Students/969.aspx" title="NHS - Disabled Students' Allowances">NHS Disabled Students’ Allowance</a> (this is a separate scheme)</li>
  <li>getting equivalent support from another funding source - eg from your university or a social work bursary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part-time students</h2>

<p>For students starting courses from 1 September 2012, part-time courses must be at least 25% of the ‘intensity’ of the equivalent full-time course each year.</p>

<p>You can check course intensity with your university or college.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If your course takes 6 years to complete but would take 3 years full-time, it has an intensity of 50%.</p>
</div>

<h2>Proving you’re eligible</h2>

<p>You won’t automatically get <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> - you need proof of your eligibility, like a letter from your doctor or specialist. </p>

<p>If you have a specific learning difficulty such as dyslexia, you’ll need to provide a ‘diagnostic assessment’ from a psychologist or suitably qualified specialist teacher. If you had this done when you were under 16, you may need to get reassessed. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you need a new diagnostic assessment but can’t afford to pay for it, you may be able to get financial help through the <a href="/access-to-learning-fund" title="Access to Learning Fund">Access to Learning Fund</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Your course</h2>

<p>Your course must be in the UK and one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a first degree, eg BA, BSc or BEd</li>
  <li>a Foundation Degree </li>
  <li>a Certificate of Higher Education </li>
  <li>a Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)</li>
  <li>a Higher National Certificate (HNC) </li>
  <li>a Higher National Diploma (HND) </li>
  <li>a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) </li>
  <li>Initial Teacher Training </li>
  <li>further training of youth and community workers </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
