<p>Postgraduates can get a single allowance of up to £10,260.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>These figures are the maximum amounts - most students get less.</p>

<h2>What <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> can pay for</h2>

<p>You can get help with the costs of:</p>

<ul>
<li>specialist equipment, like computer software</li>
  <li>non-medical helpers, like a note-taker or reader</li>
  <li>extra travel costs you have to pay because of your disability</li>
  <li>other costs, like photocopying </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> don’t cover disability-related costs you’d have if you weren’t attending a course, or costs that any student might have.</p>
</div>

<h2>Your ‘needs assessment’</h2>

<p>Once your eligibility for <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> is confirmed, Student Finance England will ask you to <a href="http://www.dsa-qag.org.uk/search.asp?both=1&amp;s=1&amp;f=0%20Find%20your%20nearest%20assessment%20centre%22" rel="external">contact an assessment centre</a> to work out what help you need. </p>

<p>This is known as a needs assessment. Don’t book this until until Student Finance England ask you to. </p>

<p>The assessment is paid for through any <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> entitlement you may have.</p>

<p>After the assessment, you’ll get a report listing equipment and other support you can get for your course.</p>

<h2>How <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> are paid</h2>

<p>Money is paid directly to who provides the service or equipment or into your bank account.</p>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for Disabled Students’ Allowances (<abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr>) if you have a: </p>

<ul>
<li>disability or long-term health condition</li>
  <li>mental health condition </li>
  <li>specific learning difficulty like dyslexia or dyspraxia</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
<li>be an undergraduate or postgraduate student (including Open University or distance learning)</li>
  <li>have a condition that affects your ability to study </li>
  <li>qualify for student finance from Student Finance England</li>
  <li>be studying on a course that lasts at least a year</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who isn’t eligible</h2>

<p>You can’t get <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> from Student Finance England if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>an EU student</li>
  <li>eligible for an <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/Students/969.aspx" title="NHS - Disabled Students' Allowances">NHS Disabled Students’ Allowance</a> (this is a separate scheme)</li>
  <li>getting equivalent support from another funding source - eg from your university or a social work bursary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proving you’re eligible</h2>

<p>You won’t automatically get <abbr title="Disabled Students' Allowances">DSAs</abbr> - you need proof of your eligibility, like a letter from your doctor or specialist. </p>

<p>If you have a specific learning difficulty such as dyslexia, you’ll need to provide a ‘diagnostic assessment’ from a psychologist or suitably qualified specialist teacher. If you had this done when you were under 16, you may need to get reassessed. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you need a new diagnostic assessment but can’t afford to pay for it, you could get help from the <a href="/access-to-learning-fund" title="Access to Learning Fund">Access to Learning Fund</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Your course</h2>

<p>Your course must be in the UK and one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a first degree, eg BA, BSc or BEd</li>
  <li>a Foundation Degree </li>
  <li>a Certificate of Higher Education </li>
  <li>a Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)</li>
  <li>a Higher National Certificate (HNC) </li>
  <li>a Higher National Diploma (HND) </li>
  <li>a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) </li>
  <li>Initial Teacher Training </li>
  <li>further training of youth and community workers </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check with your university or college that your course is recognised.</p>
</div>

<h2>Part-time course intensity</h2>

<p>For part-time students, your course intensity can affect how much you get. Intensity means how long your course takes to complete each year compared to an equivalent full-time course. </p>

<p>Part-time courses starting <strong>from</strong> 1 September 2012 must: </p>

<ul>
<li>last at least 1 year</li>
  <li>not last more than 4 times as long as the equivalent full-time course </li>
</ul>
<p>Part-time courses starting <strong>before</strong> 1 September 2012 must not last more than twice as long as the equivalent full-time course.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can check course intensity with your university or college.</p>
