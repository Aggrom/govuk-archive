</header><article id="driving-licence-requirements"><header><h1>Part 1: Driving licence requirements</h1>
  </header><p>If you pass a regular car driving test (category B) you’ll get automatic entitlement to drive the following specialist vehicles:</p>

<ul>
<li>motor tricycles, quadricycles and 3 or 4-wheeled vehicles with maximum unladen weight of 550 kg (category B1)</li>
  <li>agricultural tractors (category F)</li>
  <li>mowing machines or pedestrian-controlled vehicles (category K)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pass a category B1 test (motor tricycles, quadricycles and 3 or 4-wheeled vehicles with maximum unladen weight of 550 kg) you’ll automatically gain:</p>

<ul>
<li>provisional entitlement for agricultural tractors (category F)</li>
  <li>full entitlement for mowing machines or pedestrian-controlled vehicles (category K)</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise you’ll need the correct licence to drive a tractor or specialist vehicle on the road. To do this you’ll first need to get the right <a href="/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence" title="provisional driving licence">provisional driving licence</a> entitlement and then pass a tractor or specialist vehicle driving test to get your full licence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t need a licence to drive a tractor or specialist vehicle <strong>off the public road</strong> but there are <a href="/learning-to-drive-a-tractor-or-specialist-vehicle/age-limits" title="age limits">age limits</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You also don’t need a licence to operate pedestrian-controlled mowing machines, but you must be at least 16.</p>

<h2>Road rollers and tracked vehicles</h2>

<p>As well as the right provisional entitlement you’ll also need to hold a full car licence (category B) before you can drive:</p>

<li>road rollers</li>
  <li>tracked vehicles</li>

<p>*16 if you’re currently getting Disability Living Allowance at the higher rate (mobility component).</p>

<p>**If you’re 16 you can only drive tractors less than 2.45 metres wide and tow trailers less than 2.45 metres wide with 2 wheels, or 4 wheels close-coupled (close together).</p>

<p>***If you’re between 17 and 20 these must be small road road-rollers with metal or hard rollers. They can’t be steam powered, weigh more than 11,960kg or be made for carrying loads.</p>

<p>†If you’re between 17 and 20 the Maximum Authorised Mass (<abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr>) of the vehicle can’t be more than 3,500kg. (Maximum Authorised Mass is the maximum weight of a vehicle including the maximum load that can be carried safely while used on the road.)</p>


</article><article id="practising-driving-a-tractor-or-specialist-vehicle"><header><h1>Part 3: Practising driving a tractor or specialist vehicle</h1>
  </header><p>You can get a provisional licence for a tractor or specialist vehicle at 16, but you can’t practise driving them on the road until you’re 17.</p>

<p>The only exception is when you’re driving to or from your practical driving test. </p>

<p>Once you’re 17 you can practise driving a tractor or specialist vehicle on the road even if you haven’t passed your test.</p>

<p>If the vehicle was made with a passenger seat you must be accompanied by a qualified driver. Removing a seat is not allowed. </p>

<h2>Other rules for practising</h2>

<p>You need to display L plates (L or D plates in Wales) when you’re practising driving a tractor or specialist vehicle on public roads.</p>

<p>Your vehicle must also be properly insured and roadworthy.</p>

<h2>Finding an instructor</h2>

<p>If you’re learning to drive a vehicle with controls similar to a car and 2 front seats you might be able to use an <a rel="external" href="http://finddrivinginstructor.direct.gov.uk/DSAFindNearestWebApp/findNearest.form?lang=en" title="approved driving instructor (ADI)">approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>).</a></p>

<p>If your vehicle doesn’t have space for 2 people on board, your instructor may have to walk alongside you calling out advice.</p>


</article><article id="driving-tests-for-tractors-and-specialist-vehicles"><header><h1>Part 4: Driving tests for tractors and specialist vehicles</h1>
  </header><p>The type of driving test you have to do depends on the type of vehicle.</p>

<h2>Category B1 vehicles</h2>

<p>Before you can book a category B1 test, you must have passed the <a href="/book-a-driving-theory-test" title="driving theory test">driving theory test</a> and have a valid theory test pass certificate.</p>

<p>When booking the <a href="/book-practical-driving-test" title="practical driving test">practical driving test</a>, make it clear if the vehicle you’ll be using is a bike-based or car-based design.</p>

<h3>B1 - built like a car, with side-by-side front seats</h3>

<p>This test will be carried out as a practical car test, including an <a href="/driving-eyesight-rules" title="eyesight test">eyesight test</a>. The examiner will sit next to you giving instructions and watching how you drive.</p>

<h3>B1 - with controls and seating similar to a motorcycle</h3>

<p>This test will be carried out like a motorcycle test without:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ‘U’ turn</li>
  <li>wheeling without the use of the engine</li>
  <li>the ‘balance’ question</li>
</ul>
<p>The examiner will follow you on a motorcycle or in a car, giving you instructions over a radio system.</p>

<h2>Category F, G, H or K vehicles</h2>

<p>The examiner will give you instructions at the side of the road and watch how you drive as you go around left and right circuits.</p>

<p>For very slow vehicles, like pedestrian-controlled vehicles, your examiner may walk near you where they can watch your driving.</p>

<p>You’ll also have an <a href="/driving-eyesight-rules" title="eyesight test">eyesight test</a> and at the end of the category F, G, H or K test, you’ll be asked 5 questions on the <a href="/highway-code" title="Highway Code">Highway Code</a> and other motoring matters. You’ll then be asked to identify 6 different traffic signs.</p>

<h3>Category H tests</h3>

<p>In category H driving tests you need to drive the vehicle backwards and turn it around, using its tracks, so it’s facing the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Your examiner will tell you how you should make this manoeuvre.</p>

</article><article id="rules-for-test-vehicles"><header><h1>Part 5: Rules for test vehicles</h1>
  </header><p>All test vehicles have to meet certain rules, depending on their category.</p>

<h3>Category B1 - motor tricyles and quadricycles</h3>

<p>Category B1 includes motor tricycles, quadricycles and 3 or 4-wheeled vehicles with an unladen weight of no more than 550kg.</p>

<p>They must be able to drive at 37mph.</p>

<h3>Category F - tractors</h3>

<p>Category F includes tractors with 2 or more axles, built for off-road agriculture or forestry work.</p>

<h3>Category G - road rollers</h3>

<p>If you’re between 17 and 20, these must be small road rollers with metal or hard rollers. They can’t:</p>

<ul>
<li>be steam powered</li>
  <li>weigh more than 11,960kg</li>
  <li>be made for carrying loads</li>
</ul>
<h3>Category H - tracked vehicles</h3>

<p>Must have adequate all-round visibility to let the driver carry out manoeuvres and deal with junctions safely.</p>

<p>Any vehicle needing a second person to help with observation, such as a military vehicle, can’t be used for a category H test.</p>
