</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>A Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) is a long-term tax-free savings account for children.</p>

<h2>Who can get a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account</h2>

<p>Your child is entitled if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they were born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011</li>
  <li>you were paid <a href="/child-benefit" title="Child Benefit">Child Benefit</a> for them for at least one day before 4 January 2011</li>
  <li>your child lives in the UK</li>
  <li>they are not subject to any immigration restriction </li>
</ul>
<h3>If your child is looked after by a local council</h3>

<p>They can still get a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account if both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they were looked after by a local council before 3 April 2011</li>
  <li>they meet the other qualifying conditions above (excluding child benefit)</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you work overseas and get a European family benefit</h3>

<p>Your child can still get a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they were born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011</li>
  <li>your child lives in the UK</li>
  <li>you were paid a family benefit by another <a href="/uk-international-affairs/the-european-union-eu" title="European Union">European Union</a> country for at least one day before 4 January 2011</li>
  <li>you work in that same country</li>
</ul>
<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) sends you a voucher for each child that’s entitled to a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account. You use this to open the account in your child’s name.</p>

<p>You can add up to £3,600 a year to the account. The money belongs to the child but can’t be taken out until they are 18.</p>

<p>You could get extra money paid directly into the account - if you’re on a low income, for example.</p>

<p>There’s no tax to pay on the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> income or any profits it makes. It won’t affect any benefits or tax credits you receive.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re child isn’t eligible for a <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account, you may be able to open a <a href="/junior-individual-savings-accounts/overview" title="Junior Individual Savings Accounts (ISA)">Junior ISA</a> instead.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="child-trust-fund-vouchers"><header><h1>Part 2: Child Trust Fund vouchers</h1>
  </header><p>The voucher could be worth £250 or £50 depending on when your child became entitled to an account.</p>

<p>£250 is paid if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you first got Child Benefit (or a European family benefit) for your child on or before 2 August 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>£50 is paid if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you first got Child Benefit (or a European family benefit) for your child on or after 3 August 2010 but before 4 January 2011</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who gets the voucher</h2>

<p>The voucher is sent to the person who gets Child Benefit (or the European family benefit).</p>

<p>If a local council started to look after your child before you claimed Child Benefit, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will open the account for them instead. </p>

<h2>When to expect the voucher</h2>

<p>You’ll get the voucher within 4 weeks of getting Child Benefit.</p>

<p>If you get a European family benefit, it may take slightly longer to arrive because <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> needs to check that your child qualifies for a Child Trust Fund.</p>

<h2>If you haven’t got your voucher</h2>

<p>You can get a replacement if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your voucher didn’t arrive</li>
  <li>you lost it</li>
  <li>it was stolen</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply online for a replacement using different forms if:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CTF_Replacement_Voucher_CB_Recipient?dept-name=CTF&amp;sub-dept-name=&amp;location=6&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" title="you're the person getting Child Benefit">you’re the person getting Child Benefit</a> </li>
  <li>or if <a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CTF_Replacement_Voucher_PR_Person?dept-name=CTF&amp;sub-dept-name=&amp;location=6&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" title="you have parental responsibility">you have parental responsibility</a> but aren’t the person getting Child Benefit </li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t get a replacement within a month, contact the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0845 302 1470<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0845 366 7870<br><strong>From outside the UK:</strong> +44 1355 359 002</p>
</div>

<h2>When you get your voucher</h2>

<p>Check that your child’s name and date of birth are correct - if not, contact the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline. The voucher has an expiry date, which is 60 days after it’s issued.</p>

<p>If you don’t open an account by the expiry date, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will open an account in your child’s name. You’ll be responsible for managing it.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will not be issuing any new vouchers after 31 October 2012 and will stop issuing replacement vouchers in December 2012.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="extra-payments-"><header><h1>Part 3: Extra payments </h1>
  </header><p>Your child could get extra payments in some circumstances.</p>

<h2>If you’re on a low income</h2>

<p>Your child could get an extra payment of £250 or £50 on top of the starting payment. The amount you get will be the same as on your Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) voucher.</p>

<p>To get one of these payments both of the following must apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you qualify for <a href="/child-tax-credit" title="Child Tax Credit">Child Tax Credit</a>
</li>
  <li>you are on a ‘low income’</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Low income’ means your total household income before tax was:</p>

<ul>
<li>£16,190 or less between 6 April 2010 and 5 April 2011</li>
  <li>£16,040 or less between 6 April 2009 and 5 April 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will pay these extra payments directly into your child’s account after you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>renewed your <a href="/renewing-your-tax-credits-claim" title="tax credits">tax credits</a> (usually between April and July)</li>
  <li>been sent your final tax credits award notice</li>
</ul>
<p>Your child could also qualify for the extra <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> payment if you get any of the following for your child:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/income-support" title="Income Support">Income Support</a></li>
  <li>income-based <a href="/jobseekers-allowance" title="Jobseeker's Allowance">Jobseeker’s Allowance</a>
</li>
  <li><a href="/pension-credit" title="Pension Credit">Pension Credit</a></li>
  <li><a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>If a local council looks after your child</h2>

<p>If the local council started looking after your child before Child Benefit was claimed, the normal starting payment is doubled:</p>

<ul>
<li>£500 - paid if your child was born between 1 September 2002 and 1 August 2010</li>
  <li>£100 - paid if your child was born between 2 August 2010 and 2 January 2011</li>
</ul>
<p>If the local council started to look after your child after Child Benefit was claimed, your child won’t be entitled to any extra money. They will just get the normal starting payment.</p>

<h2>Backdated claims</h2>

<p>Children who turned 7 between 1 September 2009 and 31 July 2010 or qualified for <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance">Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</a> between 6 April 2009 and 5 April 2011 may be able to claim backdated payments.</p>

<h2>Who to contact for help</h2>

<p>If you think your child is entitled to extra <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> payments but you haven’t had them, contact the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0845 302 1470<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0845 366 7870<br><strong>From outside the UK:</strong> +44 1355 359 002</p>
</div>


</article><article id="opening-an-account"><header><h1>Part 4: Opening an account</h1>
  </header><p>When you get your voucher, take it to an approved Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) provider and they’ll open the account for you. There are 3 main types of account. </p>

<h2>Stakeholder accounts</h2>

<p>These have to follow government rules, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>investing the money in a number of companies, not just one</li>
  <li>moving the money to lower-risk investments when your child is 13</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps protect your child’s money. All <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> providers offer stakeholder accounts.</p>

<h2>Share accounts</h2>

<p>These invest your child’s money by buying shares in companies. The value can go up or down.</p>

<h2>Savings accounts</h2>

<p>These work in the same way as a bank or building society account. Money invested is secure and earns interest.</p>

</article><article id="managing-the-account"><header><h1>Part 6: Managing the account</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re the main contact for the Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) account you’re called the ‘registered contact’ and have certain responsibilities until the child is 16 and can manage their own account.</p>

<h2>Your responsibilities as the registered contact</h2>

<p>You’re the only person who can:</p>

<ul>
<li>tell the account provider how to invest the funds and run the account</li>
  <li>move the account to another provider</li>
  <li>change the type of account</li>
</ul>
<h2>Paperwork you need to keep</h2>

<p>Keep the following paperwork:</p>

<ul>
<li>your child’s Unique Reference Number - this is shown on the voucher </li>
  <li>the statements for the account</li>
  <li>details of the type of account and the provider</li>
</ul>
<p>This will make it easier if you need to query anything or make any changes to the account.</p>

<h2>Changing accounts or providers</h2>

<p>Check if the current provider offers the type of account you want to change to. If they don’t, you may need to try another provider.</p>

<p>To change provider, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a new provider</li>
  <li>contact the new provider to check what forms you need to fill in</li>
</ul>
<p>The new provider will get in touch with your existing account provider to arrange for the money to be moved. They will also tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) about the change.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From April 2013, new providers will no longer tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> about account changes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Changing a registered contact</h2>

<p>You can change the registered contact if your family circumstances have changed.</p>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Get an application form from the provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both you - and the person who wants to be the new registered contact - sign the form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return the form to the provider.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Only someone with parental responsibility for the child can be the registered contact, like a parent, step-parent or legal guardian.</p>

<p>If you split up from someone who is the registered contact and want to take this role on instead, both of you will need to agree to this.</p>

<h2>When your child is 16 or 18</h2>

<p>When your child is 16 they can take over the account and manage it. When they’re 18, they can take the money out.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A child can still choose to let their registered contact manage the account when they turn 16.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="adding-money-to-the-account"><header><h1>Part 7: Adding money to the account</h1>
  </header><p>Anyone can pay money into a Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) account.</p>

<h2>How much you can add</h2>

<p>You can put £3,600 a year into the account - the start date for the year is the child’s birthday and the end date is the day before their next birthday. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the £3,600 limit isn’t used in a year, you can’t carry any unused amount forward to the following year to make up the difference.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to pay money in</h2>

<p>For stakeholder accounts you can add money by:</p>

<ul>
<li>cheque</li>
  <li>standing order</li>
  <li>direct debit</li>
</ul>
<p>For savings or share accounts, check with your provider.</p>

<h2>Government payments</h2>

<p>Payments made by the government don’t count towards the £3,600, apart from:</p>

<ul>
<li>payments made by the Welsh government up to 31 January 2011</li>
  <li>payments made by a local council to a child they are looking after</li>
</ul>
<h2>The year you open the account</h2>

<p>There are different rules for the first year. The start date is the day the account is opened but the end date is still the day before the child’s next birthday. </p>


</article><article id="if-your-child-is-terminally-ill-or-dies"><header><h1>Part 8: If your child is terminally ill or dies</h1>
  </header><p>You can take money out of your child’s Child Trust Fund (<abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr>) account if they are terminally ill. If your child has died, the money passes to whoever inherits the child’s estate (their property and possessions). </p>

<h2>If your child is terminally ill</h2>

<p>‘Terminally ill’ means that they have a disease or illness that is going to get worse and are likely to die within 6 months. Only the registered contact can take money out.</p>

<h3>How to take money out</h3>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline to let them know that:</p>

<ul>
<li>your child is terminally ill</li>
  <li>you want to take the money out of the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> account </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to provide evidence that your child is terminally ill.</p>
</div>

<p>If your child is already getting <a href="/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit" title="Disability Living Allowance (DLA)">Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</a> because of their illness, tell the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline when you contact them.</p>

<p>If your child doesn’t get <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> office will send you a form for your doctor to complete and return to them.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0845 302 1470  <br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0845 366 7870  <br><strong>From outside the UK:</strong> +44 1355 359 002</p>
</div>

<h2>If your child dies</h2>

<p>The money in the account will be paid to the person who inherits the child’s estate. This is often one of the child’s parents, but if your child was married, it could be their husband or wife.</p>

<p>If you weren’t able to open the account before your child died, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will still pay you what your child was entitled to. </p>

<p>If you get <a href="/changes-affect-child-benefit" title="Child benefit if a child dies">Child Benefit</a> for a child who has died this can still carry on for a short time. It may also help with any extra costs you face at this time.</p>

<h3>What you need to do</h3>

<p>You need to do the following:      </p>

<ul>
<li>if the account has already been opened - tell the account provider</li>
  <li>if you haven’t opened an account yet - tell the <abbr title="Child Trust Fund">CTF</abbr> Helpline</li>
</ul>
<p>The account provider will usually need proof, like the death certificate.</p>
