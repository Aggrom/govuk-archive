</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>To become a lorry or bus driver you first need to apply for the correct provisional entitlements on your driving licence and include a medical report.</p>

<p>You’ll then need to pass:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/become-lorry-bus-driver/bus-and-lorry-driver-theory-test" title="theory and hazard perception tests">theory and hazard perception tests</a></li>
  <li>the <a href="/become-lorry-bus-driver/bus-and-lorry-driver-practical-driving-test" title="practical driving test">practical driving test</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to drive a bus or lorry for a living you’ll also need to complete <a href="/become-lorry-bus-driver/driver-certificate-of-professional-competence-driver-cpc" title="the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (Driver CPC)">the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (Driver CPC)</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>For driver licensing, lorries are called Large Goods Vehicles (<abbr title="Large Goods Vehicles">LGVs</abbr>) and buses or coaches are called Passenger Carrying Vehicles (<abbr title="Passenger Carrying Vehicles">PCVs</abbr>).</p>
</div>


</article><article id="driving-licence-requirements"><header><h1>Part 2: Driving licence requirements</h1>
  </header><p>For driver licensing, lorries are called Large Goods Vehicles (<abbr title="Large Goods Vehicles">LGVs</abbr>) and buses or coaches are called Passenger Carrying Vehicles (<abbr title="Passenger Carrying Vehicles">PCVs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Before you can train to become a <abbr title="Large Goods Vehicle">LGV</abbr> or <abbr title="Passenger Carrying Vehicle">PCV</abbr> driver you must normally be aged over 18 and hold a full car licence (category B entitlement).</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are some exceptions to the age limit - <a href="/vehicles-you-can-drive" title="Check which vehicle categories you can drive">check which vehicle categories you can drive.</a></p>
</div>

<p>You’ll then need to add the right provisional entitlements to your licence before you can take your tests.</p>

<p>The type of driving licence entitlement you need depends on the ‘maximum authorised mass’ (<abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr>) of the vehicle you want to drive.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr> is the total vehicle weight plus the maximum load it can carry:</p>

<ul>
<li>vehicles with a <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr> of more than 3.5 tonnes but no more than 7.5 tonnes need a C1 licence</li>
  <li>vehicles with a <abbr title="Maximum Authorised Mass">MAM</abbr> of more than 7.5 tonnes need a category C licence</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a trailer entitlement (+E) to your licence, you’ll need to hold the full entitlement for the vehicle before you take the trailer test.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> To drive an articulated vehicle, you need to pass category C, and then pass category C+E to get the correct licence.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you lose your car licence entitlement you’ll automatically lose your <abbr title="Large Goods Vehicle">LGV</abbr> or <abbr title="Passenger Carrying Vehicle">PCV</abbr> licence.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your entitlement to drive <abbr title="Large Goods Vehicles">LGVs</abbr> or <abbr title="Passenger Carrying Vehicles">PCVs</abbr> is valid until you’re 45 - then you have to renew it every 5 years until you’re 65, and every year from 65 onwards.</p>

  </header><p>The rules for lorry and bus driving licences will change from 19 January 2013.</p>

<h2>New drivers passing a driving test from 19 January 2013</h2>

<p>If you pass your driving test in categories C, CE, C1, C1E, D, DE, D1 or D1E, after 19 January 2013 you’ll get a licence valid for 5 years.</p>

<p>Every 5 years up to age 45, you’ll need to sign a declaration to show you still meet the medical standards.</p>

<h3>Drivers under 45 years old</h3>

<p>If you passed a driving test in one of the categories below, you’ll come under the new rules when you renew your driving licence.</p>

<p>The categories affected are C, CE, C1, C1E, D, DE, D1 or D1E.</p>

<p>When you renew your licence, you’ll receive a licence valid for 5 years. Every time you renew you’ll need to confirm you still meet the medical standards.</p>

<p>If you apply to replace your licence because it is lost or stolen, or your personal details have changed, your new licence will run until the end of your original period.</p>

<p>However, if you update your photo at the same time, you’ll come under the new 5-year rule.</p>

<h3>Drivers over 45 years old</h3>
