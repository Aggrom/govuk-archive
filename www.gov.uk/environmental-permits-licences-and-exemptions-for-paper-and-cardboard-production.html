<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Your paper and cardboard production business may need a permit, licence, authorisation or exemption to prevent your activities from causing pollution or harming human health. The paper and cardboard industry includes paper and paperboard manufacturers, and businesses that produce paper and paperboard products. It also includes businesses that carry out finishing activities, such as coating, covering, laminating and embossing paper or cardboard.</p>

<p>Paper and cardboard production businesses can have a number of impacts on the environment, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>energy use from equipment and machinery, as well as lighting, heating and cooling</li>
  <li>noise pollution from vehicles, equipment and machinery</li>
  <li>waste disposal such as sludge and old machinery, equipment and containers</li>
  <li>water discharges from effluent and wastewater treatment plant</li>
  <li>water use such as in the production process and for cooling</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will help you check if your business needs an environmental permit, registered exemption or other environmental authorisation, such as a trade effluent consent or hazardous waste registration.</p>

<p>You can be fined or even sent to prison if you don’t have the correct permit, licence, authorisation or exemption.</p>

<h2 id="listed-activity-permits-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Listed activity permits for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p>You must have an environmental permit from the Environment Agency or your local authority if you carry out listed activities at an installation or mobile plant. You must ensure that the installation or mobile plant you use to carry out listed activities does not cause pollution.</p>

<p>An installation is a stationary technical unit, such as a self-contained building, permanent structure or fixed plant, used for listed activities.</p>

<p>Mobile plant is equipment that is designed to be, and will be, moved and is used for listed activities. When mobile plant is used on an installation it may become part of the installation activity, and so may be included in the permit of the installation.</p>

<p>Listed activities include industrial and waste activities that have an environmental impact. They are split into three categories - Part A(1), A(2) and B. Part A permits control a range of environmental impacts, including emissions to air, land and water. Part B permits control emissions to air only.</p>

<h3 id="part-a-listed-activities">Part A listed activities</h3>

<p>Activities at paper and cardboard production sites regulated under Part A include:</p>

<ul>
<li>producing pulp from timber or other fibrous materials in industrial plant</li>
  <li>producing paper and board in industrial plant that has a production capacity of more than 20 tonnes per day</li>
  <li>making paper pulp or paper, including activities connected with recycling paper such as de-inking, if the activity may result in the release into water of certain hazardous substances, such as mercury, cadmium and various chlorinated hydrocarbons</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-b-listed-activities">Part B listed activities</h3>

<p>Activities at paper and cardboard production sites regulated under Part B include using a boiler or furnace with a net rated thermal input of 20-50 megawatts.</p>

<h3 id="solvent-activities">Solvent activities</h3>

<p>If you use organic solvents, you may require an environmental permit from the Environment Agency or your local authority. If you have a permit you must comply with its conditions, which may require you to reduce or control your solvent emissions.</p>

<p>Contact the Environment Agency or your local authority for further information about listed activities.</p>

<h2 id="waste-permits-exemptions-and-registrations-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Waste permits, exemptions and registrations for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p>If your business uses, stores, recovers or disposes of waste you must ensure it does not cause pollution. You must check if your waste activities need a permit or exemption from the Environment Agency. You must have the appropriate authorisations in place before you start an activity.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-permits-for-waste-activities---when-you-need-one">Environmental permits for waste activities - when you need one</h3>

<p>You must have an environmental permit if your waste activities are classified as listed activities or waste operations.</p>

<p>Listed waste activities include some waste incineration plants and landfills.</p>

<p>Waste operations are waste disposal or recovery activities that require an environmental permit. Mobile plant can be used to carry out waste operations - this is known as waste mobile plant.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087477593&amp;topicId=1086287989">environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply.</a></p>

<h3 id="waste-exemptions---activities-covered">Waste exemptions - activities covered</h3>

<p>You must usually register an exemption from environmental permitting if you carry out an exempt waste operation. You must comply with the conditions in your registered exemption.</p>

<p>If you discharge anything other than clean, uncontaminated run-off to surface water or groundwater you could cause water pollution. Surface waters include rivers, reservoirs and canals. Groundwater is all water located below the water table.</p>

<p>If you carry out a water discharge activity or a groundwater activity you must have an environmental permit or exemption from the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>Your paper and cardboard business may create wastewater or effluent from materials that you store or handle, and processes you use on your site, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>process effluent, eg from deinking operations</li>
  <li>effluent or other treatment plants</li>
  <li>boiler operations</li>
  <li>cooling processes</li>
  <li>cleaning operations</li>
  <li>site drainage and stormwater run-off</li>
</ul>
<p>Wastewater or run-off may contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>suspended solids</li>
  <li>oil and fuels</li>
  <li>heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium</li>
  <li>acids and alkalis, which affect the pH of the water</li>
  <li>solvents</li>
  <li>softening or brightening agents</li>
  <li>biocides, eg plant protection chemicals</li>
  <li>cleaning products</li>
</ul>
<p>You should handle these substances with care at all stages of processing and manufacture as they can pollute surface waters and groundwater.</p>

<p>If you pollute water, or risk causing environmental damage to water, you may be committing an offence.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087477593&amp;topicId=1086287989">environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply.</a></p>

<h2 id="trade-effluent-consents-and-agreements-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Trade effluent consents and agreements for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p>Trade effluent is any liquid waste, other than domestic sewage and uncontaminated surface water, that you discharge from your business premises.</p>

<p>Discharges that your paper and cardboard production business might make to a sewer include:</p>

<ul>
<li>trade effluent from industrial processes, eg sludges</li>
  <li>boiler blowdown</li>
  <li>water from cooling processes</li>
  <li>water from washing and cleaning</li>
  <li>water running off from car parking areas</li>
</ul>
<p>A public foul sewer collects foul water (sewage and trade effluent) only. A surface water sewer collects surface water drainage only. A public combined sewer collects both foul and surface water drainage.</p>

<p>You must dispose of sewage from domestic facilities, eg toilets, basins and kitchens, to either a public foul sewer or to a public combined sewer.</p>

<p>You must dispose of trade effluent to either a public foul sewer or to a public combined sewer.</p>

<p>You must dispose of clean uncontaminated water to either a separate surface water sewer or to a public combined sewer.</p>

<h3 id="discharges-to-public-sewers---when-you-need-permission">Discharges to public sewers - when you need permission</h3>

<p>You must get permission from your water and sewerage company before you discharge to their drainage system. If you are a tenant you may need your landlord’s permission to connect to a private surface water drain.</p>

<p>Before you release trade effluent into a public sewer you must have a trade effluent consent or enter into a trade effluent agreement with your water and sewerage company. Once you have a consent you must comply with its conditions. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087477593&amp;topicId=1086676178">discharging trade effluent.</a></p>

<p>You do not need permission to discharge sewage from domestic facilities to the nearest public foul sewer or to a public combined sewer. If you have any concerns about your discharges to sewer, contact your water and sewerage company.</p>

<p>If your business is in an area where you can’t be connected to a public sewer, you may have a septic tank or package treatment plant. However, you will need authorisation from the Environment Agency.</p>

<h2 id="water-use-licences-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Water use licences for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p>The paper industry uses large volumes of water in the production process, including as a fibre carrier and as a solvent. You should reuse water within your process wherever possible.</p>

<p>If you take or store surface water or groundwater from any source, you are abstracting or impounding water.</p>

<p>If you abstract or impound surface water or groundwater you can affect the environment and other water users.</p>

<h3 id="water-abstraction-licence">Water abstraction licence</h3>

<p>You must have an abstraction licence from the Environment Agency if you abstract more than 20 cubic metres of water per day from groundwater or surface waters.</p>

<h3 id="water-impoundment-licence">Water impoundment licence</h3>

<p>You must have an impoundment licence from the Environment Agency if you impound (store) water on a watercourse, for example using a dam, weir or in a reservoir.</p>

<h3 id="flood-defence-consent">Flood defence consent</h3>

<p>You must have a flood defence consent from the Environment Agency before you:</p>

<ul>
<li>carry out any work in, over, under or adjacent to a main river</li>
  <li>build a flow control structure such as a culvert or a weir on an ordinary watercourse</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="carbon-and-other-air-emission-authorisations-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Carbon and other air emission authorisations for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p><abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> and other air emissions from your business’s activities can cause air pollution, contribute to climate change and harm human health. You must check if your emissions need a permit, registration or other consent from the Environment Agency or your local authority.</p>

<h3 id="greenhouse-gas-permit">Greenhouse gas permit</h3>

<p>Some energy intensive businesses are required to reduce <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions and trade allowances under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Emissions Trading System (<abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>). You should check if your business needs a permit under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your paper and cardboard installation must have an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> permit if your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>produces pulp from timber or other fibrous materials in industrial plant</li>
  <li>produces paper and board in industrial plant that has a production capacity of more than 20 tonnes per day</li>
  <li>carries out combustion installation activities with a rated thermal input exceeding 20 megawatts</li>
</ul>
