  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>A collective (or group) passport is a way for organised groups of young people to make trips to certain European countries.</p>

<p>The passport isn’t intended for families - it’s for groups like:</p>

<ul>
<li>schools and 6th form colleges</li>
  <li>scouts</li>
  <li>guides</li>
  <li>other recognised youth organisations</li>
</ul>
<p>Collective passports are for between 5 and 50 children. If there are more than 50 in the group you can split it up and apply for 2 or more passports.</p>

<p>A collective passport costs £39 and applications take about 6 weeks. The rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>everyone on the passport must be a British national and under 18 by the end of the trip </li>
  <li>there must be a group leader over 21 with a valid 10-year British passport </li>
</ul>
<p>You should also have a deputy group leader. The passport will become invalid if the group leader can’t travel, but if a deputy is named on the application, they could take over. </p>

<p>Deputy leaders must be over 21 years old and hold a valid 10-year British passport.</p>

<p>A ‘British national’ is someone who is a:</p>

<ul>
<li>British citizen </li>
  <li>British overseas territories citizen</li>
  <li>British overseas citizen</li>
  <li>British subject</li>
  <li>British national (overseas)</li>
  <li>British protected person</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no guarantee that collective passports will be accepted or rejected in any country  - wherever possible, young people should travel on their own passports.</p>
