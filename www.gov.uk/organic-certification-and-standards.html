<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Organic food production within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is strictly regulated.</p>

<p>If you are a farmer, grower, food processor, storage provider and/or an importer of organic food from a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, or if you market organic products, you must be registered with an approved organic control body (<abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>). You must also be inspected at least once a year to ensure that you meet the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide standards. Only then can your products legally be labelled and marketed as ‘organic’.</p>

<p>This guide looks at the initial steps you must take towards the registration, inspection and certification of your farm/or other business premises as ‘organic’.</p>

<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) is the authority responsible for organic farming regulations in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="organic-regulation">Organic regulation</h2>

<p>The word ‘organic’ is defined in law. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules apply to the organic production and to the labelling and control of organic products.</p>

<p>Organic control bodies (<abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr>) license individual organic operators. They are approved by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. You must be registered with one of the <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr>, comply with their standards and meet their requirements in order to market your produce as ‘organic’.</p>

<p>Each or all of the following activities require registration with an approved <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>producing or processing organic food or products</li>
  <li>importing organic food or products from third countries, ie those outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (with named exceptions) - for more information, see the guide on importing organic produce</li>
  <li>producing organic animal feeds</li>
  <li>re-labelling organic products at any stage of the distribution chain</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are considering converting to organic, you will need to think about the implications in terms of time, cost and the changes you might have to make. For more information, see the guide on converting to organic farming. To find out whether you’re eligible for funding, see the guide on Organic Entry Level Stewardship (OELS).</p>

<p>Once you have decided to go organic and have chosen an approved <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>, you’ll need a copy of their standards and an application form.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/growing/organic/standards/certbodies/approved.htm">Find a list of approved UK <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-organic-certification">Applying for organic certification</h2>

<p>Although <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states cannot set higher organic standards (<abbr title="Organic Standards">OS</abbr>) than those in force for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as a whole, <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> can. You should bear this in mind when you apply to different <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> for their information packs.</p>

<p><abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> are licensed and controlled by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>). You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/growing/organic/standards/certbodies/approved.htm">find a list of approved UK organic <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="application-forms">Application forms</h3>

<p>You can download the application forms that apply to your business and return these to the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>, or you can phone the relevant <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> to request them. The <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> will then contact you to arrange a mandatory inspection. When you apply to register with a <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>, you agree to work to its standards and open your farm and all its processes to the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>’s annual and ad hoc inspection regime. You will not be fully certified until you have completed a conversion period, which normally lasts at least two years. For more on this topic, see the guide on converting to organic farming.</p>

<p>To complete your application form, you will need to provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>your full name and address, farm name and the trading name of the main holding and any other holdings</li>
  <li>the total size of the holding(s) and the number of hectares you wish to convert to organic</li>
  <li>the name and address of any advisers you employ</li>
  <li>the names, addresses and licence numbers of any contracted storage and handling facilities you use</li>
  <li>information on all the crops or livestock your farm produces and any on-farm process you carry out</li>
  <li>confirmation of whether you have used sewage sludge, insecticides, fungicides or herbicides in recent years</li>
</ul>
<p>In your application, you will also have to briefly set out how you propose to manage soil fertility and manure and describe how you plan to source, store and handle waste. You will also have to briefly describe your crop rotation plan and its aims. You will later need to expand on these and other processes in your full conversion plan. You may wish to contact the Organic Conversion Information Service (<abbr title="Organic Conversion Information Service">OCIS</abbr>), which offers advice to help farmers convert to organic farming.</p>

<h3 id="processing-and-stores">Processing and stores</h3>

<p>If any stage of the processing of products takes place on your farm, you must cover this in your application. Any stores or other buildings in which production processes take place - either on your farm or by contractors on other farms - must also be inspected. This includes processes such as the washing, drying and/or cold storage of produce you have grown.</p>

<p>When you register farm production, you need to include:</p>

<ul>
<li>each farm production unit, down to individual fields and including their <abbr title="Organic Standards">OS</abbr>/Rural Land Register (<abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr>) numbers</li>
  <li>each production enterprise - eg dairy cattle, vegetables, and/or cereals</li>
  <li>a named manager as head of each production unit</li>
</ul>
<p>Only products from the named fields and enterprise units can be certified and thus marketed as organic.</p>

<p>You must complete the form and return it to the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> with a fee. The <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> will then send you their standards manual and the forms in which you will have to briefly describe your conversion plan. After assessing your application, the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> will contact you to arrange an inspection.</p>

<h2 id="inspection-of-your-organic-operation">Inspection of your organic operation</h2>

<p>After choosing a <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> for your organic certification, you should study their standards manual to check that you can agree to and are able to achieve the standards they set. Different <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> may set different standards. Although these standards cannot be any lower than those set by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, they can be more demanding.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted your application, and paid the requested fee to the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>, they will assess it and contact you to arrange an inspection of your operation.</p>

<h3 id="your-compliance-notice">Your Compliance Notice</h3>

<p>Following the inspection, the inspector will give you a detailed written report and a Compliance Notice. This sets out a summary of the actions and improvements you must carry out to reach the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>’s standards. You should study the compliance notice to make sure you can meet its requirements, sign it to show your consent, add any missing information, and return it to the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>. You should carry out any requested improvements, after which a second inspection may be required by the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> after evaluating the inspector’s report.</p>

<p>If the inspector does not encounter any problems during the inspection, ie your holding(s) and processes are found to fully comply with the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>’s standards, they will use the compliance notice to notify you of their favourable decision. In this case, you will not have to sign and return it.</p>

<h2 id="conversion-following-inspection">Conversion following inspection</h2>

<p>After their first inspection of your operation, the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> may grant you initial registration, subject to their report. You won’t get the report on the inspection immediately. It can take several weeks as the inspector’s report is considered by a certification officer and may be referred to the <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>’s certification committee. You will however be able to start the conversion period immediately.</p>

<p>The annual cost of certification will vary from one <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> to another. The size of the holding, whether or not it is located in a less favoured area, and even your age can all affect the cost.</p>

<h3 id="your-certificate-of-compliance-and-schedule">Your Certificate of Compliance and Schedule</h3>

<p>Once you have completed all the above stages, the farm will be registered as ‘in conversion’ and a Certificate of Compliance - complete with a Schedule - will be issued. This specifies your fields have been certified and given <abbr title="Organic Standards">OS</abbr>/<abbr title="Rural Land Register">RLR</abbr> reference numbers. It also states whether each field is in conversion or remaining under conventional management, and the date the conversion began.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> should notify <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> that the process has been completed.</p>

<p>You should keep a copy of the certificate ready in case customers ask to see it.</p>

<h3 id="business-considerations-during-the-conversion-period">Business considerations during the conversion period</h3>

<p>During the first 12 months of the conversion period, you must sell all your crops as non-organic. Those you harvest after the first 12 months of the conversion period may be marketed under the label - ‘produced under conversion to organic farming’.</p>

<p>There is a market for conversion cereals and legumes for stock feed, and a developing market for conversion fruit and vegetables. If you run a farm shop, you can also sell the produce of the farm under this label. You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.soilassociation.org/Farmersgrowers/Routestomarket/tabid/153/Default.aspx">find out find out how to buy or sell conversion produce about the different routes to organic markets on the Soil Association website</a>. You can also <a rel="external" href="http://92.52.112.178/web/sa/om.nsf/homepage?openform">register to offer for sale livestock, forage and feedstuffs on the organic marketplace on the Soil Association website</a>.</p>

<p>To find out whether you are eligible for funding, see the guide on OELS.</p>

<h3 id="gradual-conversion">Gradual conversion</h3>

<p>You do not need to convert the whole farm to organic production all at once. You could start by registering an area large enough to achieve a sustainable organic unit that meets prescribed conditions. If you convert the farm in stages, you could avoid a large loss in yield and/or income all at once. It will take time for a new organic system to reach past yields, especially if you previously used soluble fertilisers and synthetic pesticides.</p>

<p>During the conversion process, you may only use materials and practices listed in the organic standards. For example, you will no longer be able to use most soluble fertilisers and synthetic pesticides.</p>
