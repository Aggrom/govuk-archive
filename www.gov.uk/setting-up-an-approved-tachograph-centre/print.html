  <li>£148 to renew your registration each year </li>
</ul>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Approved Tachograph Centre">ATC</abbr> manual tells you what equipment you’ll need to buy. </p>

</article><article id="who-can-work-for-you"><header><h1>Part 3: Who can work for you</h1>
  </header><p>You can only employ ‘nominated technicians’ to carry out work at an Approved Tachograph Centre (<abbr title="Approved Tachograph Centre">ATC</abbr>). They must be skilled technicians with experience working on tachographs.</p>

<p>If they need to road test vehicles, they must also have a driving licence for the relevant categories of vehicles they’re testing.</p>

<p>They’ll also need to hold a ‘certificate of competence’ for each class of tachograph (digital, analogue or both) that they want to work on. </p>

<p>They’ll get this only after they’ve  successfully completed a Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>)-approved training course. You’ll find details in the <abbr title="Approved Tachograph Centre">ATC</abbr> manual.</p>

</article><article id="tachograph-workshop-smart-cards"><header><h1>Part 4: Tachograph workshop smart cards</h1>
  </header><p>A tachograph workshop card is used to calibrate digital tachographs. To be eligible for a workshop card, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be a nominated technician working at an Approved Tachograph Centre (<abbr title="Approved Tachograph Centre">ATC</abbr>) with digital status </li>
  <li>hold a digital training certificate </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Tachograph workshop cards are issued free of charge. They are automatically renewed every year on 31 March.</p>
</div>

<p>The cards are issued to a nominated technician, not to a centre - this means that only the individual who has the card can use it. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re the nominated technician and you work at 2 workshops, you’ll need a card for each workshop.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>Fill out an application form D778B and send it to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>), along with a copy of an up to date analogue and digital training certificate.  Once <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has checked and approved your application it will be forwarded to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>), who will issue your card to the <abbr title="Approved Tachograph Centre">ATC</abbr> where you work.  </p>

<p>You’ll need a PIN code to use a workshop card. This will be sent to your home address, and must only be used by you. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you enter the wrong PIN code 5 times in a row it will lock the card and you’ll need to apply for a new card using form D778b.  You will also be issued with a new PIN code</p>

<h2>Working with tachograph workshop cards</h2>

<p>Workshop cards can hold:</p>

<ul>
<li>details of 88 calibrations</li>
  <li>a small amount of events and faults data</li>
</ul>
<p>A workshop card must not be used instead of a company card. If you have a card used by your calibration centre, this must only be used in accordance with the tachograph centre’s duties and not as a substitute company card.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>All insertions of a card are recorded on the vehicle unit and the card.</p>
</div>

<h2>Renewal of workshop cards</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> sends a renewal list to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> 2 months before a card’s expiry. This is then checked and returned to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> with details of technicians whose cards can be renewed.</p>

<p>You must report any lost or stolen cards to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> and the police immediately.</p>

<p>If your card is lost or stolen, you can apply for a replacement by sending a D778B application form to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>. You’ll need to provide a police incident reference number for stolen cards.</p>

<h2>If your card stops working</h2>

<p>Try using the card in a different vehicle unit. If it still doesn’t work, send form D778B with the faulty card to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> to get a new card.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Any misuse of workshop cards may lead to the withdrawal of your nominated technician and tachograph centre’s approval.</p>
