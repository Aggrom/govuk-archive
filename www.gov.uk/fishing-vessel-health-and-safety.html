<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations 1997 includes measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at sea.  Owners must also ensure their crews follow safe working practices and that all equipment on board is properly installed and maintained.</p>

<p>This guide explains health and safety provisions and how to ensure crew working practices are safe by complying with regulations for safe manning levels and working times. You will also find information on the safe use and maintenance of work equipment and fishing gear, as well as emergency and lifesaving equipment.</p>

<p>The guide also outlines risk assessment of hazards and provides a list of organisations that can supply further information on safe working practices for fishing vessels.</p>

<h2 id="fishing-vessel-health-and-safety">Fishing vessel health and safety</h2>

<p>Under the Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations 1997 Regulations, it is your duty to protect the health and safety of workers and others affected by their activities.</p>

<p>There are certain fundamentals you can follow to ensure health and safety on a fishing vessel, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>risk avoidance - combating risks at source by replacing dangerous practices, substances or equipment with less or non-dangerous ones</li>
  <li>risk evaluation - taking action to reduce unavoidable risks</li>
  <li>individual work patterns and procedures - workplace design and equipment to alleviate monotonous work</li>
  <li>procedural adaptation - using new technology and other changes to improve working practices, equipment and the working environment</li>
  <li>vessel management - logical approach that takes account of health and safety at every level</li>
  <li>protective measures - prioritise collective measures over individual</li>
  <li>training and information - appropriate and relevant for all workers</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information on health and safety aboard fishing vessels, see <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/workingatsea/mcga-healthandsafety.htm">the health and safety section on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fishing-vessel-owners-and-operators-responsibilities">Fishing vessel owners’ and operators’ responsibilities</h2>

<p>Fishing vessel owners are responsible for ensuring their vessels comply with the regulations for construction and how they are operated. There are separate regulations for vessels of less than 15 metres in overall length, for vessels 15 metres to less than 24 metres in length and for over 24 metres in length.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessels-below-15-metres-in-length---general-responsibilities">Fishing vessels below 15 metres in length - general responsibilities</h3>

<p>Fishing vessels less than 15 metres in length are covered by the safety regulations explained in the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>’s Merchant Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr>) 1813 (F).</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/msn_1813_amended_5.pdf">download <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1813 (F) Code of Safe Working Practice for Small Fishing Vessels from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 362K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessels-15-metres-to-less-than-24-metres-in-length---general-responsibilities">Fishing vessels 15 metres to less than 24 metres in length - general responsibilities</h3>

<p>Fishing vessels 15 metres to less than 24 metres in length must be built, maintained and operated according to the provisions of the code set out in the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> document <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1770 (F).</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/1770_a.pdf">Download <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1770 (F) Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction and Use of 15m Length Overall to less than 24m Registered Length Fishing Vessels from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 1.23MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessels-of-24-metres-length-and-above---general-responsibilities">Fishing vessels of 24 metres length and above - general responsibilities</h3>

<p>For vessels of 24 metres’ registered length and over, construction and operating standards are set out in the Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999 - as amended in 2003 (‘the 2003 regulations’). The 2003 regulations apply only to vessels built after January 2003.</p>

<p>See the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2998/contents/made">Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999 on the legislation.gov website</a> and the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/1112/contents/made">Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) (Amendment) Regulations 2003 on the legislation.gov website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are building a new vessel of this size, or your vessel was built after 1999, you will need to order a printed version of the Torremolinos Protocol to understand your responsibilities. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.imo.org/Publications/Pages/Home.aspx">order the Torremolinos Protocol on the International Maritime Organization website</a>.</p>

<p>If your vessel was built before 1999, you will also need to comply with the safety requirements listed in the Fishing Vessels (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975.</p>

<h3 id="other-responsibilities-for-fishing-vessel-owners-and-operators">Other responsibilities for fishing vessel owners and operators</h3>

<p>There are numerous other responsibilities that owners and operators of fishing vessels must follow to ensure the safety and health of seafarers. In particular, you must adhere to regulations regarding:</p>

<h2 id="safe-watchkeeping-navigation-and-avoiding-accidents">Safe watchkeeping, navigation and avoiding accidents</h2>

<p>Fishing vessel operators should follow recommendations on keeping a safe navigation watch.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-watch-on-fishing-vessels">Keeping watch on fishing vessels</h3>

<p>The requirements are set out in the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> document, <abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr> 313 (F) - keeping a safe navigational watch on fishing vessels.</p>

<p>Safety recommendations for watchkeeping include the following provisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>seafarers keeping watch must be competent to do so</li>
  <li>a proper lookout must be kept at all times</li>
  <li>lookouts must be capable of checking the vessel’s position</li>
  <li>activities of all other vessels in the area should be monitored</li>
  <li>seafarers should have had enough rest before a watch</li>
  <li>television and similar distractions should not be available to crew on watch</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wheelhouse-visibility">Wheelhouse visibility</h3>

<p>Wheelhouse visibility safety requirements are specified in the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>’s <abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr> 314 (F) document, wheelhouse visibility onboard fishing vessels.</p>

<p>Safety principles for wheelhouse visibility for fishing vessels include:</p>

<ul>
<li>as little obstruction as possible to wheelhouse view from bow structures</li>
  <li>clear view ahead from steering position for all new fishing vessels</li>
  <li>arrangements to improve visibility where necessary - eg through use of lookouts</li>
  <li>taking account of effects of ice and fishing gear on forward visibility</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="navigation-in-restricted-visibility-conditions">Navigation in restricted visibility conditions</h3>

<p>Safety requirements for navigating fishing vessels in conditions of reduced visibility are set out in the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> document <abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr> 369 (M+F) Navigation in restricted visibility.</p>

<p>The recommendations include guidance on:</p>

<ul>
<li>proper conduct of vessels in restricted visibility conditions</li>
  <li>determining risk of collision in close quarters</li>
  <li>correct avoiding actions</li>
  <li>compliance with steering and sailing rules</li>
  <li>determining safe speeds and a close-quarters situation in conditions of restricted visibility</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="communications-between-wheelhouse-and-engine-room">Communications between wheelhouse and engine room</h3>

<p>For fishing vessels over 24 metres but less than 45 metres in length, communication between the wheelhouse and propulsion machinery can be carried out by means other than an engine room telegraph. Machinery space control stations in vessels of this size can be used as emergency stations - as long as the wheelhouse has monitoring and control facilities.</p>

<p>Owners of fishing vessels of 45 metres and over should provide two separate means of communication between the wheelhouse and machinery space control platform. One of these should be an engine room telegraph.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-accidents-from-fatigue-or-overwork">Avoiding accidents from fatigue or overwork</h2>

<p>Fishing vessel operators can reduce the chance of accidents on vessels caused by fatigue or overwork.</p>

<p>Causes of fatigue among fishing crews include:</p>

<ul>
<li>frequent port turnarounds</li>
  <li>regular 12 hours or more working days</li>
  <li>stress</li>
  <li>adverse weather conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Reduced concentration and performance are among the physical effects of fatigue.</p>

<p>Vessel operators should know how to detect signs of fatigue - such as changes in mood and alertness. Practical measures to alleviate the problem include drinking water, regular breaks and taking naps.</p>
