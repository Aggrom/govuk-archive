<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The term ‘Cross Compliance’ refers to the requirement for farming practices to meet certain standards. These apply to you if you receive direct payments under Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) support schemes or through certain Rural Development Schemes. This includes the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) - the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s main agricultural subsidy scheme.</p>

<p>The standards that have to be met as part of Cross Compliance are known as Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>) and Standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (<abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr>). They apply to all farming activities across your entire agricultural holding, regardless of the amount of land you have entered into the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>This guide contains general information about <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> and <abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr>, the requirements you must meet, key dates and how to assess your current levels of compliance. There is information about the inspection process, and how direct payments can be reduced if Cross Compliance requirements aren’t met.</p>

<h2 id="cross-compliance-requirements-and-key-areas-of-farming-activity">Cross Compliance requirements and key areas of farming activity</h2>

<p>If you receive <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> payments - eg the single payment - or certain other Rural Development Scheme payments, you must meet Cross Compliance requirements. These requirements apply across all farming activities - with the majority falling into the following key areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>record keeping</li>
  <li>soil management, cultivation and ploughing</li>
  <li>spraying and spreading</li>
  <li>harvesting and post-harvesting activities</li>
  <li>keeping livestock</li>
  <li>maintaining landscapes and protecting habitats</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> apply to each key farming activity. For example, <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 16, 17 and 18 apply to keeping livestock and record keeping for animal welfare purposes.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/629e03951e3863b9802573aa004fe167!OpenDocument">find a list of key dates on the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a table showing a summary of key dates and applicable <abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr>/<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> for 2011</p>

<h2 id="cross-compliance-requirements-for-2011">Cross Compliance requirements for 2011</h2>

<p>Cross Compliance is a system that requires farmers to fulfil certain requirements if they are to receive their payments under the Common Agricultural Policy. It sets the baseline standards that you must meet to receive your payment.</p>

<p>These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Domestic legal requirements to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition. These mainly protect soils, habitats and landscape features. See the guide on standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC).</li>
  <li>European legal requirements known as <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>. These cover environmental and plant health objectives, as well as animal health and welfare. See the guide on SMRs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not directly applicable to individual farmers, national requirements to maintain a level of permanent pasture - ie land under grass with no other crops for five years or more - will also influence farming practices.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/crosscompliance/guidance/faq/">find frequently asked questions on the Cross Compliance website</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a conflict between the requirements of a land-based rural development scheme and <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> measures, you will normally have to meet the rural development requirements. If you are in any doubt, you should contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Customer Service Centre on Tel 0845 603 7777 or via email at <a href="mailto:CSC@rpa.gsi.gov.uk">CSC@rpa.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="key-dates-for-2011">Key dates for 2011</h2>

<p>If you are receiving payments under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, there are a range of key dates when certain Cross Compliance requirements must be met.</p>

<p>These key dates are set out in the annual guidance provided by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. These dates are relevant to particular standards of <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> and to particular <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>See a table of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">the key dates and applicable <abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr>/<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> for 2011</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance-responsibility-for-the-whole-year">Cross Compliance responsibility for the whole year</h3>

<p>Although you can activate entitlements for any land at your disposal up until 16 May, you are responsible for Cross Compliance requirements for the whole calendar year. For example, if you take on some agricultural land on 1 April and it forms part of your holding on 16 May, you are liable for any breaches of Cross Compliance that occurred between 1 January and the date you took on the land. There is one exception to this rule. If the transferor in this case submits a claim in that calendar year, they will be liable for breaches during the period that the land was at their disposal.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you claim on some land which you then transfer out after 16 May, you will still have to ensure that cross compliance requirements relating to that land are met until the end of the calendar year. There is also an exception to this rule, namely where the transferee submits a claim in that calendar year, they will be liable for cross compliance breaches during the period that the land was at their disposal.</p>

<p>So, it may be wise to include Cross Compliance requirements in the terms of any contract with the new land manager.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/21c99ddaeb3232a9802573aa004efa3e!OpenDocument">browse the index to <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> Cross Compliance guidance on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cross-compliance-inspections">Cross Compliance inspections</h2>

<p>Your farm can be selected for a Cross Compliance inspection if you receive payments from:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> </li>
  <li>Area Payment for Nuts </li>
  <li>Protein Crop Premium </li>
  <li>Environmental Stewardship Schemes (<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>, <abbr title="Organic Entry Level Stewardship">OELS</abbr>, <abbr title="Uplands Entry Level Stewardship">UELS</abbr> and <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>) </li>
  <li>Uplands Transitional Payment (<abbr title="Uplands Transitional Payment">UTP</abbr>) </li>
  <li>Energy Crop Scheme </li>
  <li>English Woodland Grant Scheme</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspections are carried out by the four Competent Control Authorities (<abbr title="Competent Control Authorities">CCAs</abbr>), each having different areas of responsibility relating to specific standards of <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The four <abbr title="Competent Control Authorities">CCAs</abbr> and their inspection responsibilities</p>

<p><abbr title="Competent Control Authority">CCA</abbr> Areas of responsibility</p>

<p>Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>)
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 &amp; 12 <abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr> 1 to 18</p>

<p>Environment Agency
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 2 to 4 <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 18</p>

<p>Veterinary Medicines Directorate
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 10</p>

<p>Animal Health
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 13 to 18</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="Competent Control Authority">CCA</abbr> will select and carry out inspections on farms that need to comply with the requirements covered by its area of responsibility. Inspections are mainly chosen by risk assessment, but there is also a random element.</p>

<p>Due to the random element, it’s possible for your farm to be inspected more than once in a calendar year. Your business could also be selected for inspection by more than one <abbr title="Competent Control Authority">CCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will be given advance notice of an inspection where possible, but they can be unannounced. In either case, you must co-operate with the inspectors. If you don’t, your payments may be reduced or withheld, and/or an animal movement restriction could be served on your farm.</p>

<p>The inspector will explain what they have found before leaving your farm. They will then write-up a full report to submit to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, who will use the report to assess if there has been any non-compliance.</p>

<p>Any breaches may result in a reduction to your payment. The level of reduction is dependent upon the seriousness of the non-compliance - see the section below on penalties for breaching Cross Compliance requirements.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will write to you to confirm the findings of the inspection, but they cannot confirm any payment reduction until the results of all inspections carried out during the calendar year have been assessed.</p>

<h2 id="penalties-for-breaching-cross-compliance-requirements">Penalties for breaching Cross Compliance requirements</h2>

<p>If you receive payment under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, other <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> support schemes or certain rural development schemes, you face penalties if you don’t meet your Cross Compliance obligations.</p>

<p>Remember that your Cross Compliance requirements apply in addition to any other underlying European and UK legislation. If you don’t meet those obligations you could face other penalties, as well as losing <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> payments.</p>

<p>All agricultural activities are covered by Cross Compliance and you must comply with the requirements across the whole agricultural area of your holding. This is regardless of how much land you have entered into the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="sps-payment-reductions-for-non-compliance">
<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payment reductions for non-compliance</h3>

<p>If you negligently fail to meet a standard or requirement, your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments and other direct payments can be reduced by between 1 and 5 per cent for the first instance of non-compliance. The figure depends on the extent, severity and permanence of the breach.</p>

<p>The starting point for a first time breach that is rectifiable is 1 per cent for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> 2011 (including direct payments for Area Payments for Nuts, Protein Crop Premium and Aid for Energy Crops) and for Pillar 2 schemes, such as Environmental Stewardship schemes. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations state that the reduction can be increased or reduced, depending on the severity of the breach. Intentional repetitive non-compliance can result in your payment being reduced by up to 100 per cent.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/E96F8A110D38DD7B802570C70047643A?Opendocument">find the payment reduction matrixes which the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> uses to assess deductions on their website</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> publishes an annual breakdown of non-compliances found during inspections. This includes details of the most common breaches.</p>
