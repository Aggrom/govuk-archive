<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Social impact bonds (<abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr>) are designed to help reform public service delivery. <abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr> improve the social outcomes of publicly funded services by making funding conditional on improvements. Investors pay for the project at the start, and then receive a payment based on the results achieved by the project.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on inputs (eg number of doctors) or outputs (eg number of operations), <abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr> are based on achieving social ‘outcomes’ (eg improved health). The outcomes are predefined and measurable.</p>

<p>This guide provides introductory information to help commissioning organisations (government departments, local councils and other public service organisations) who are beginning to consider whether to develop a social impact bond.  It will also be useful for those are considering investing in a social impact bond, and for organisations that want to deliver a project funded by a social impact bond.<br>
For more detailed information on developing social impact bonds, contact the <a href="mailto:sibs@cabinet-office.gsi.gov.uk">Centre for Social Impact Bonds</a> at the Cabinet Office. </p>

<h2 id="the-purpose-of-social-impact-bonds">The purpose of social impact bonds</h2>

<p><abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr> provide a number of benefits for commissioners, service providers and investors:</p>

<ul>
<li>they allow commissioners to attract private investors to fund early and preventative action on complex and expensive social problems</li>
  <li>they enable new services to be tried without commissioners having to pay if they don’t work </li>
  <li>they can help services to adapt so that they have a greater emphasis on prevention</li>
  <li>they can allow greater flexibility for those providing the services to adapt and change the service according to their experience</li>
  <li>they can help charities and social enterprises bid for and manage ‘payment by results’ (<abbr title="Payment by results">PbR</abbr>) projects - projects where the government pays the provider of the service for the results achieved</li>
</ul>
<p>Because performance is measured according to the outcomes produced rather than the service being delivered, there is more room for innovation and greater freedom to demonstrate solutions that work.  The result is better outcomes for the public and reduced costs to Her Majesty’s Government.</p>

<p>Payment is based on what the project or service has achieved, not the processes or work that has been done.  For example, payments might be based on whether or not the project has lowered the rate of which prisoners reoffend, rather than the cost of the project or the number of people working on the project.  </p>

<p>The diagram below shows how <abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr> work: initial funding is paid for by investors to cover the costs of the project.  The provider carries out the project, and the investor is paid by the government according to the results achieved, at specific points agreed in the contract.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Social impact bonds: how they work" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1104/image_new.jpg"></div>
</figure><h2 id="how-to-decide-whether-a-sib-is-likely-to-be-appropriate">How to decide whether a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> is likely to be appropriate</h2>

<p>An organisation commissioning a service or project could consider a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the desired outcome is clear and measurable (eg reducing recidivism)</li>
  <li>the quality of outcomes can improve</li>
  <li>there is a desire to increase evidence of effective programs </li>
  <li>government is looking to transfer financial risk</li>
  <li>there is a desire to catalyse the market for innovative financing</li>
  <li>a large proportion of savings are cashable or funding is available for this outcome</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="carrying-out-a-feasibility-study">Carrying out a feasibility study</h2>
<p>Before a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr>-funded social service begins, commissioners should examine its expected costs and savings by carrying out a feasibility study. </p>

<p>Commissioners should decide if it’s possible to carry out the feasibility study internally or if external help is needed, eg an intermediary or consulting support. Intermediaries can provide useful specialist knowledge of <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> design and project management support. </p>

<p>As part of the feasibility study, the commissioner (or other party if they’re leading the project) should identify who’s likely to be interested in or affected by the project, and engage with them early in the process.  </p>

<h3 id="defining-measurable-intended-outcomes-for-the-project">Defining measurable intended outcomes for the project</h3>

<p>When identifying outcomes for a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr>, consider if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the outcome can be measured easily and accurately</li>
  <li>the outcome can be linked directly to some kind of intervention</li>
  <li>achievement of the outcome saves money, either by directly reducing costs or by avoiding likely future cost</li>
  <li>some of the money saved is cashable, eg cash savings that could be put into a bank, like a reduction in legal costs; some savings are not directly cashable but are highly socially beneficial, like an improvement in exam results</li>
</ul>
<p>Commissioners should make sure that any perverse incentives - elements of the contract that encourage behaviour that would undermine the overall aims of the project or service – are properly managed.  As long as the organisation making referrals is separated from financial interests, the <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> is largely protected from perverse incentives. </p>

<h3 id="identify-the-cohort-for-measuring-the-outcomes-of-the-project">Identify the cohort for measuring the outcomes of the project</h3>

<p>It’s important that the performance of the project is accurately measured. The feasibility study helps to carefully identify the characteristics of the group of people who should participate in the programme (‘the cohort’), and a source of comparison data – either a control group or baseline data. </p>

<p>The provider should not be able to pick and choose who they work with, unless the payment tariff takes account of the make-up of the cohort.  It can be useful to include specific payments for results relating to groups within the cohort where it is likely to be more difficult to achieve the intended outcomes of the project.</p>

<h3 id="define-the-financial-outcomes-of-the-project">Define the financial outcomes of the project</h3>

<p>The feasibility study should assess how the payments between the investor, provider and commissioner of the service should be structured, based on the costs, savings and intended outcomes of the project. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> developer should calculate the potential costs of the service, along with the potential savings and the amount of tangible cash savings. 
The <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> developer can then allocate the costs and the savings to relevant beneficiaries. If other government bodies benefit from the <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr>, they might be interested in co-commissioning the <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr>. </p>

<p>It’s also useful to identify the timings of the costs and savings. This will help determine how much working capital is required from the investor and when it will be possible to pay outcomes payments. </p>

<h2 id="commissioning-and-procurement">Commissioning and procurement</h2>

<p>The procurement process will need to be approached differently depending on which type of <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> is proposed, and depending on the specific circumstances of each project. </p>

<h3 id="identifying-and-working-with-potential-investors">Identifying and working with potential investors</h3>

<p>Investors risk losing money if the public service doesn’t achieve its outcomes. <abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr> are not traditional bonds - they are quasi-equity, which means the investor can be exposed to all the downside risk, eg they can risk losing the initial investment. </p>

<p>Any organisation can become an investor in a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr>. Investors in <abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr> in the UK are typically charitable trusts and social investors.  </p>

<p>The commissioner should make sure that they can provide answers to the questions investors are likely to be asking. Investors consider all facts before investment (known as due diligence) by asking:</p>

<ul>
<li>does the proposed social outcome match the company’s ideals? </li>
  <li>does the project meet the investment criteria? </li>
  <li>what’s the risk of them having to provide extra money during the contract?</li>
  <li>where’s the evidence that this proposed solution works?</li>
  <li>how good is the provider’s track record in this area?</li>
  <li>how trustworthy is the provider?</li>
  <li>what risk will be taken on? (they will use this to decide the rate of return they expect on their investment)</li>
  <li>what controls will there be over delivery?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-a-provider">Finding a provider</h2>

<p>Finding a charity or social enterprise (service provider) to run the service can be a lengthy process. </p>

<p>Commissioners will generally want to follow the protocol of a Class B procurement for social services rather than a Class A procurement for financial services. </p>

<p>Some important considerations in setting the requirements of an invitation to tender (ITT) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much money is available to pay for successful outcomes</li>
  <li>the minimum number of people needed to participate in the programme for it to achieve the desired results</li>
  <li>the agreed payment structure and triggers</li>
  <li>independently verifying the measurements of a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr>’s success and payment structure</li>
</ul>
<p>During the procurement process, commissioners should make contingency plans in case the provider fails to achieve the outcomes set out in the contract, so that the service can continue to be provided.  </p>

<h2 id="performance-management">Performance management</h2>

<p>Social investors and intermediaries usually want some control or at least influence over the way the project is delivered, given that they’re taking much of the risk. This can be achieved in a number of ways, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>buying a share in the provider organisation and/or taking a seat on the board </li>
  <li>attaching a number of conditions to an investment, such as rights to take control of or terminate the project in the event of sustained under-performance </li>
  <li>engaging an intermediary to manage provider performance throughout the contract </li>
</ul>
<p>Social investors often use performance management techniques to make sure projects are rigorously managed according to strong social values.  Social investors often insist on:</p>

<ul>
<li>a rigorous data collection system</li>
  <li>basing decisions on data</li>
  <li>tracking and reporting impact</li>
  <li>detailed periodic financial and performance reporting </li>
</ul>
<p>If providers are not achieving outcomes, there are several potential ways commissioners can intervene: </p>

<ul>
<li>providing training and support to help the provider develop their skills and systems </li>
  <li>redistributing the workload to share with another provider</li>
  <li>replacing providers if outcomes aren’t being achieved (depending on the terms of the contract)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sources-of-funding-for-sib-projects">Sources of funding for <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> projects</h2>

<h3 id="social-outcomes-fund">Social Outcomes Fund</h3>

<p>The Social Outcomes Fund is a £20m fund managed by the Cabinet Office.  It is intended to deal with the main problems holding up the growth of <abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr>: the difficulty of aggregating benefits and savings which accrue across multiple public sector spending ‘silos’ in central and local government. </p>

<p>The fund will be used to provide a ‘top-up’ contribution to outcomes-based commissions (<abbr title="Payment by results">PbR</abbr> or <abbr title="Social impact bonds">SIBs</abbr>) that are designed to deal with complex and expensive social issues. This will catalyse innovative new projects in areas where no single commissioner can justify making all of the outcomes payments, but where the wider benefits mean that a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> is value for money. Reporting and assessment of performance data is a condition of funding, and will also generate evidence on the effectiveness of the project to overcome these barriers in the future. It operates only in England, with funding available to: </p>

<ul>
<li>government departments</li>
  <li>local councils</li>
  <li>other commissioning bodies, like police forces or the clinical commissioning groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications to the fund must involve <abbr title="Payment by results">PbR</abbr> and ideally be financed by a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr>.  Applications at Expression of Interest stage can be submitted by any group, but final applications must be submitted by commissioners. They must also:</p>

<ul>
<li>deal with a social issue that affects multiple parts of the public sector</li>

<thead><tr>
<th>What we could fund</th>
      <th>We would not fund</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A bid from a local authority for top-up payments to allow them to introduce a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> to improve outcomes for troubled families by providing up front funding to a charity to carry out a project</td>
      <td>A bid that is not <abbr title="Payment by results">PbR</abbr> - eg up-front funding for teaching support staff  in disadvantaged areas</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>A bid from a central government department for top-up payments in a <abbr title="Payment by results">PbR</abbr> scheme to help problem drug users</td>
      <td>A bid that doesn’t deliver social value in a complex area of policy eg reducing littering</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>A bid from a clinical commissioning group for example, this could be done by targeting people at risk of falls</td>
      <td>A bid that tops up additional outcomes in an existing <abbr title="Payment by results">PbR</abbr>/<abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> programme - eg a top-up for reduced drug consumption in a <abbr title="Payment by results">PbR</abbr>/<abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> focusing on reoffending</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>A bid from a Police and Crime Commissioner for top-up payments in a <abbr title="Social impact bond">SIB</abbr> aiming to reduce gang membership</td>
      <td>A bid where there are no savings - eg increasing crime detection</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that not all outcome payments have to be made from the commissioner; some could be made by an organisation with an interest in a particular area, such as a charity. The fund encourages bids from multiple commissioners acting jointly.
A non-public sector intermediary may also be involved.  </p>
