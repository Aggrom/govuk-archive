  </header><p>You must be authorised to talk to the Tax Credit Office about someone else’s tax credits. If you’re not, every time you call they must confirm their identity during the call. </p>

<h2>Get authorised</h2>

<p>It usually takes 2 days to authorise someone. You must: </p>

<ul>
<li>send form TC689 to the Tax Credit Office</li>
  <li>you, your partner (if you make a joint application for tax credits) and the person you’re representing must sign the form</li>
</ul>
<p>The authorisation lasts 12 months unless you put a different end date on the form. Usually, you won’t get a letter confirming your authorisation, it can take a few days to set up. </p>

<p>More than one person can be authorised but each one must have sent a Form TC689. </p>
