<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Days at Sea scheme is a UK initiative restricting the number of days per year that vessels can fish in the cod recovery zone (<abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr>). The aim of the scheme is to allow cod and sole stocks to recover in this area, improving long-term sustainability, and allows the UK to comply with EU Regulation 1342/2008.</p>

<p>Under the scheme, if you wish to operate a fishing vessel in the <abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr> you will need to apply for an annual allocation of days you may fish, according to the type of fishing gear you use. The scheme is administered in the UK by the by the Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guide explains how the days at sea scheme may affect your cod fishing vessel, potential exemptions and penalties.</p>

<h2 id="notification-of-intention-to-carry-regulated-gears">Notification of intention to carry regulated gears</h2>

<p>As the master of a vessel (or their representative), in order to receive your days at sea allocation you must notify the local port office as to which categories of regulated gear the vessel will carry in the forthcoming period. You should make an application before the first day of each management period. The port office will provide you with the application form.</p>

<p>An application to transfer in days for a vessel which does not have eligibility in its own right will also count as notification.</p>

<p>A management period can be a period of one or more months.</p>

<p>If you apply for a new management period that ends the previous management period with a deficit (that is, where the allocated days have been used before the end of the management period), no allocation will be made for the new period until more days are transferred in to eliminate the deficit.</p>

<p>For example, if a fisherman is allocated 135 days for TR1 gears (whitefish gear) for 12 months, but uses them in 10 months and then opts to begin a new management period using a different gear type, the previous management period will have ended with a deficit of 22.5 days. Therefore, no allocation can be made for the remaining two months of the original 12-month period until more days are transferred in.</p>

<p>Any days remaining at the end of a management period will not be transferred into the new management period. Days not used by the end of a management period are therefore lost.</p>

<p>Vessels are allowed to carry only one type of regulated gear at any time.</p>

<h3 id="regulated-gears">Regulated gears</h3>

<p>The regulated gears are listed in Annex 1 to EC Regulation 1342/2008. You can <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:348:0020:01:EN:HTML">read the Regulation 1342/2008 on the Eur-LEX website</a>.</p>

<p>To be eligible to use them, you must also have a record of fishing activity with those gears at some point during the years 2001-05.</p>

<p>Vessels eligible to notify gear category TR1 may carry any category of regulated gear.</p>

<p>When you have notified the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> via your port office, they will send you your allocation of days. </p>

<p>For advice, you can call the Fisheries Management and Control Team - Days at Sea Scheme on 0191 376 2596 or email them at <a href="mailto:daysatsea.transferrequests@marinemanagement.org.uk">daysatsea.transferrequests@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="days-at-sea-allocation">Days at sea allocation</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Effort Management Team will send letters to eligible vessels giving their allocation of days for the management period. You should carry this letter on board at all times when fishing in the <abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr> with regulated gears. The letter will also specify areas where your vessel may fish.</p>

<p>You should apply for an allocation for a single grouping of regulated gears, such as TR1 and TR2, or a combination. If you notify for more than one category of gear, your allocation of days will be the average of the rates for the categories notified.</p>

<p>The flat rates for basic allocations for the gear groups in 2010 are set out in the table below.</p>

<p>Vessels will receive an allocation of days in proportion to the duration of the management period notified.</p>

<h3 id="vessels-catching-less-than-5-cod">Vessels catching less than 5% cod</h3>

<p>If you agree to catch less than 5% cod when notifying any regulated gear, you will be allocated additional days at sea. If you make any trip that involves activity within the <abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr> for all or part of the trip, the 5% limit on cod catches will need to be observed.</p>

<p>Fishermen wanting to transit through the <abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr> to fish outside it must lash and stow their gear whilst in the <abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr> (both there and back).</p>

<p>A vessel will revert to the standard allocation for the rest of the scheme year if:</p>

<ul>
<li>on one occasion it lands more than 5% cod</li>
  <li>an inspection at sea records a catch of cod that is 5% or more of the total catch</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be required to transfer days if your vessel has already exceeded the standard allocation.</p>

<h3 id="allocation-of-additional-days-at-sea-buy-backs">Allocation of additional days at sea (buy backs)</h3>

<p>You can also apply to receive extra allocated days if you agree to fish exclusively using specified gear during the management period. The options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Eliminator trawl - this option is available to TR1 vessels. Vessels using this receive 24 days’ extra allocation.</li>
  <li>130 millimetres cod end - this option is available to TR1 vessels carrying gear with a cod end of mesh size 130 millimetres or greater. Vessels using this receive eight days’ extra allocation.</li>
  <li>Nephrops Square Mesh Panel (<abbr title="Nephrops Square Mesh Panel">SMP</abbr>) - the insertion of a 120 millimetres <abbr title="Nephrops Square Mesh Panel">SMP</abbr> of minimum length three metres in the straight extension of the net or a 130 millimetres <abbr title="Nephrops Square Mesh Panel">SMP</abbr> in the taper.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transferring-days-at-sea">Transferring days at sea</h2>

<p>Transfers of days at sea are subject to controls. They are also limited to a set percentage of a vessel’s allocation - 20% for TR1 and TR2 gears and 30% for other gears. This means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>A vessel donating days to another can only donate up to that percentage of its allocation of days to other vessels</li>
  <li>Once days are transferred to a vessel they may not be transferred out (this is to prevent the accumulation of days onto individual vessels as a form of banking - however, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will consider allowing such transfers out in some circumstances)</li>
  <li>Recipient vessels are not restricted in terms of how many days they can receive</li>
  <li>Transfers of effort will only be allowed where the donor and recipient vessels are both administered by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>For vessels receiving extra days at sea by complying with special conditions (such as the 5% limit on cod catches), they can only transfer days from vessels that are operating under the same conditions</li>
  <li>Vessels that are ineligible to carry regulated gears may transfer in days from eligible vessels to allow them to fish in the cod recovery zone</li>
</ul>
<p>Where a transfer takes place, the number of days received by the recipient will be adjusted in proportion to its fishing capacity (measured in engine power) compared to the other vessel.</p>

<p>You can call the Fisheries Management and Control Team - Days at Sea Scheme on 0191 376 2596 or email them at <a href="mailto:daysatsea.transferrequests@marinemanagement.org.uk">daysatsea.transferrequests@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="penalties-for-breaching-days-at-sea-rules">Penalties for breaching days at sea rules</h2>

<p>Penalties for breaching the days at sea scheme rules are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fishing in an area of seasonal closure, when in effect - a deduction of seven days</li>
  <li>Fishing in an area of real time closure, when in effect - a deduction of five days</li>
  <li>Carriage on board of more than one category of regulated gear - on the first occasion, removal of recording of time at sea in hours (where appropriate), on the second and each subsequent occasion, a deduction of five days</li>
  <li>Fishing in an area of advised cod avoidance after notifying the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> that you will not fish in these areas - on the first occasion, removal of recording of time at sea in hours (where appropriate), on the second occasion, a deduction of days awarded in relation to avoidance of area in the management period, including any days used from that additional allocation</li>
  <li>Failing to fish exclusively with specified gear after notifying <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> that you will - on the first occasion, removal of recording of time at sea in hours (where appropriate), on the second occasion, a deduction of days awarded in relation to use of gear in the management period, including any days used from that additional allocation</li>
  <li>Failing to accept an observer on board in response to a reasonable request - on the first occasion, no penalty, on the second occasion, removal of recording of time at sea in hours (where appropriate), on each subsequent occasion, a deduction of five days</li>
</ul>
<p>The Effort Management Team will give consideration to any exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>If the Team is considering applying a penalty, it will notify you in writing of the intention to impose the penalty, and the reasons for this.</p>

<p>On receipt of this notification, you may appeal. Such appeals should in the first instance be lodged with the Effort Management Team. However, any appeal will be considered by a senior officer within the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> outside the team.</p>
