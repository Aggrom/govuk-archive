</table></article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>Eligibility depends on: </p>

<ul>
<li>your nationality or residency status</li>
  <li>your university or college </li>
  <li>your course</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To qualify for a Maintenance Loan, you need to be under 60 when you start your course - there’s no upper age limit for grants or Tuition Fee Loans.</p>
</div>

<h2>Nationality or residency status</h2>
<p>The following should apply: </p>

<ul>
<li>you’re a UK national or have ‘settled status’ (no restrictions on how long you can stay)</li>
  <li>you normally live in England </li>
  <li>you’ve been living in the UK for 3 years before starting your course </li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be eligible if your residency status is one of the following:</p>

<li>refugee</li>
  <li>humanitarian protection (as a result of a failed application for asylum)</li>
  <li>migrant worker</li>
  <li>child of a Swiss national</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national</li>
  <li>child of a Turkish worker</li>

<h2>Your university or college</h2>
<p>This should be a university, college or other institution that offers a qualifying course. It must be in the UK and either:</p>

<ul>
<li>funded by the government</li>
  <li>privately funded but running courses that get government funding</li>
</ul>
<p>Check with your university or college if you’re not sure whether they meet these conditions.</p>

<h2>Your course</h2>
<p>This should be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a first degree, eg <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</abbr>, <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BSc</abbr> or <abbr title="Bachelor of Education">BEd</abbr>

  <li>a Certificate of Higher Education</li>

</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check with your university or college if you’re not sure whether your course is recognised.</p>
</div>

<p>Generally you’ll only get student finance if you’re doing your first higher education qualification. However, you may still get it if, for example: </p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve changed course </li>
  <li>you’ve withdrawn from your course but decide to start again </li>
  <li>you’re ‘topping up’ a higher education qualification – for example, you’ve finished an <abbr title="Higher National Certificate">HNC</abbr>, <abbr title="Higher National Diploma">HND</abbr> or foundation degree and now want to do an honours degree </li>
</ul>
<h3>Part-time students</h3>
<p>Part-time courses need to be least 25% of an equivalent full-time course (for example 4 years instead of 1 year full time). This is known as ‘course intensity’. You can check course intensity with your university or college. </p>
