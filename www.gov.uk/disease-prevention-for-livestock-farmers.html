<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a livestock farmer you are probably already using hygiene and biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of animal disease.</p>

<p>This guide brings together resources and new information for livestock farmers in England on animal diseases - including notifiable diseases and diseases that are infectious to humans - dealing with fallen stock, and farm health planning.</p>

<h2 id="routine-good-hygiene-and-biosecurity-measures">Routine good hygiene and biosecurity measures</h2>

<p>There are several hygiene and biosecurity measures that should be part of your farm routine.</p>

<h3 id="general-biosecurity-measures">General biosecurity measures</h3>

<p>The key to good biosecurity is reducing and controlling the movements of people, vehicles or equipment into areas where your farm animals are kept. Some diseases are more prevalent than others. For example, if you keep livestock, you will particularly be on the alert for foot and mouth disease whereas poultry keepers need to be vigilant against avian influenza (bird flu).</p>

<p>You should cleanse and disinfect protective clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with farm animals. Where practicable, you should use disposable protective clothing.</p>

<p>Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) - a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) agency - is responsible for ensuring that farm animals are healthy, disease-free and well looked after.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool</a> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</p>
</div>

<p>Good hygiene and biosecurity is essential to:</p>

<ul>
<li>prevent the introduction of animal disease</li>
  <li>protect the health of your animals and workers</li>
  <li>reduce the risk of disease exposure to any members of the public who visit your farm - this is particularly important if you hold open days or farm visits</li>
</ul>
<p>Your biosecurity measures need to be routine because:</p>

<ul>
<li>farm animal diseases can be easily spread</li>
  <li>disease may not always be apparent - especially in the early stages</li>
</ul>
<p>Farm animal diseases are mainly spread through:</p>

<ul>
<li>animals, people and machinery moving between and within farms</li>
  <li>farm visitors - people and vehicles</li>
  <li>introducing new animals</li>
  <li>contact with neighbours’ livestock</li>
  <li>shared farm equipment</li>
  <li>contamination by vermin and wild birds</li>
  <li>animals drinking from contaminated rivers and streams</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="biosecurity-at-agricultural-markets-and-shows">Biosecurity at agricultural markets and shows</h3>

<p>It is essential to keep up and improve standards of biosecurity on farms, in markets and on livestock vehicles to cut down the risk of spreading disease.</p>

<p>Under the Animal Gatherings Order 2010, a general licence is required for any livestock gathering - eg markets and shows - alongside the industry’s commitment to best practice.</p>

<p>The golden rule is ‘clean in, clean off’:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t bring onto or take off the market any vehicle, equipment or clothing contaminated with animal excreta - other than the inside of vehicles or protective clothing taken off the site for disposal or laundering</li>
  <li>don’t leave the animal area without cleaning any contamination from your clothes</li>
  <li>don’t leave the animal area without cleansing and disinfecting your boots</li>
</ul>
<p>Biosecurity measures at markets and shows are legally enforceable.</p>

<h3 id="livestock-movements-identification-and-tracing">Livestock movements, identification and tracing</h3>

<p>Strict rules control identifying and moving livestock - even if you only keep one animal. You should know the health status of any animals before buying them. When new animals first arrive, you should keep them separate from other livestock and handle them last. You can find out about these rules in sheep and goats identification, registration and movement, cattle identification, registration and movement, pigs identification, registration and movement and deer health, welfare and movement.</p>

<h3 id="the-national-control-programme-ncp-for-salmonella-in-poultry-laying-flocks-and-eggs">The National Control Programme (<abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr>) for Salmonella in poultry, laying flocks and eggs</h3>

<p>If you keep hens or produce eggs, you must also comply with the <abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr>, which places duties on farmers to detect, control and eliminate all Salmonella serotypes of significance to public health. The <abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr> requirements apply to:</p>

<ul>
<li>laying flocks of more than 350 hens on a single premises</li>
  <li>eggs for hatching and farmyard poultry chicks</li>
  <li>eggs in shell for human consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information by reading poultry: an overview.</p>

<h2 id="notifiable-farm-animal-diseases-and-protecting-people">Notifiable farm animal diseases and protecting people</h2>

<p>There are many types of farm animal illnesses, some of which are notifiable. A notifiable disease is a named disease that must be reported to the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. Some diseases - called ‘zoonoses’ - can be passed on to people and it is critical that they are recognised and controlled.</p>

<p>For more information on symptoms and preventive measures of notifiable diseases, read disease notification and restrictions.</p>

<p>Notifiable farm animal diseases in the UK include major diseases, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>avian influenza - also known as AI</li>
  <li>bovine spongiform encephalopathy - also known as <abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> - and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies</li>
  <li>tuberculosis</li>
  <li>bluetongue</li>
  <li>classical swine fever</li>
  <li>foot and mouth disease</li>
  <li>Newcastle disease</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out more about notifiable diseases in cattle by reading cattle health.</p>

<p>For more information on notifiable diseases in other farm animal species, read poultry health, pig health, and sheep and goat health.</p>

<h3 id="notification">Notification</h3>

<p>If you suspect signs of a notifiable disease - as listed on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website - you must immediately contact an <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool</a> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</p>
</div>

<p>You must impose movement restrictions on your farm if you believe your stock may be infected with a notifiable disease. If a notifiable disease is confirmed, the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> puts in place measures to control the outbreak.</p>

<p>You must make plans to ensure the welfare of your stock, and you should consider the likely implications of movement controls during an outbreak when preparing contingency plans for your business - eg making provision for keeping animals past their intended slaughter weight.</p>

<p>If you have general concerns about the health of animals in your care, you should first check with your own vet.</p>

<h3 id="stock-inspection-and-caring-for-sick-animals">Stock inspection and caring for sick animals</h3>

<p>Signs of notifiable farm animal diseases vary widely according to the disease and species of animal.</p>

<p>Good stockmanship and vigilance will increase your chances of spotting disease among your livestock.</p>

<p>Your farm staff should inspect animals thoroughly at least daily, and you should ensure that there is adequate lighting for them to do so.</p>

<p>You should care for any sick animals immediately, and seek veterinary advice if they don’t respond to your care. Sick animals should be isolated in a suitable place, with dry, comfortable bedding.</p>

<h3 id="farm-diseases-that-affect-people---zoonoses">Farm diseases that affect people - zoonoses</h3>

<p>Zoonoses are animal infections and diseases that can be passed on to humans and are covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (<abbr title="Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations">COSHH</abbr>) 2002. </p>

<p>Types of zoonoses in the UK include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Escherichia coli O157 (E coli O157) - causes illness ranging from diarrhoea to kidney failure, and can be fatal</li>
  <li>Salmonella - effects include diarrhoea, fever and abdominal pains</li>
  <li>Cryptosporidium parvum - may cause diarrhoea and abdominal pains, with flu-like symptoms for up to six weeks</li>
  <li>Leptospirosis (Weill’s disease and cattle-associated leptospirosis) - both may lead to jaundice, meningitis and kidney failure</li>
  <li>bovine tuberculosis</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read about the National Control Programme for Salmonella in poultry: an overview.</p>

<p>You can download an information sheet on common zoonoses in agriculture from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/ais2.pdf">Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) website (PDF, 117K).</a></p>

<h2 id="disease-prevention-and-cross-compliance">Disease prevention and cross compliance</h2>

<p>Cross compliance requirements apply to you if you receive direct payments under Common Agricultural Policy support schemes or if you receive payments under certain Rural Development schemes. To receive your full subsidy payment you must comply with the Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>) and standards of good agricultural and environmental condition requirements that apply to your business.</p>

<p>If you don’t carry out your <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> obligations, you may face enforcement action and even prosecution.</p>

<p>A number of <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> apply to disease prevention and control, including <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 12, 13, 14 and 15 for the prevention and control of animal disease.</p>

<p>The aim of <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 12, 13, 14 and 15 is to minimise the risk posed to human and animal health by certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), foot and mouth, bluetongue and other animal diseases. These will apply to you if you keep farmed animals.</p>

<h2 id="controlling-farm-diseases-that-can-infect-humans">Controlling farm diseases that can infect humans</h2>

<p>The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) publishes guidance on the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (<abbr title="Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations">COSHH</abbr>), which relate directly to animal diseases on farms.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations">COSHH</abbr> 2002 regulations cover diseases that can spread from animals to humans. These diseases are known as zoonoses. </p>

<p>Transmission can affect both farm workers and visitors. If your farm is open to the public, it is particularly important for you to have preventative measures in place.</p>

<p>Where zoonoses are known or likely to be present on the farm, you will need to carry out a <abbr title="Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations">COSHH</abbr> risk assessment.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations">COSHH</abbr> regulations, employers and self-employed people must:</p>

<li>assess risks to health from work activities which involve a hazardous substance - eg a microorganism</li>
  <li>prevent or control exposure to the hazardous substances</li>
  <li>introduce and maintain control measures</li>
  <li>inform, instruct and train employees about risks and precautions</li>
  <li>regularly review risk assessments and effectiveness of control measures</li>
</ul>
<p>When making risk assessments, you must involve farm employees and especially safety representatives.</p>

<p>You should also ask employees - or potential employees - if they have any health conditions, such as suppressed immunity, which may make them vulnerable to zoonoses.</p>

<p>For more guidance, download an information sheet on zoonoses in agriculture from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/ais2.pdf">HSE website (PDF, 117K).</a></p>

<h2 id="farm-health-planning">Farm health planning</h2>

<p>Farm health planning (<abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr>) is one of the most effective ways of tackling animal disease and improving your livestock’s performance. The main benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>improved farm profits</li>
  <li>improved sustainability</li>
  <li>better stock health and welfare</li>
  <li>a farmer/vet relationship focused on improving performance</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> is based on four key principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>measure - use your records to identify how much disease costs your farm each year</li>
  <li>manage - with your vet or other adviser, prioritise control measures for problem health areas, using cost/benefit calculations and the most effective health management methods</li>
  <li>monitor - regularly review the progress of your <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> and change it as necessary</li>
  <li>seek advice - prevention is better than cure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cattle-fhp">Cattle <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Cattle herd health planning involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>recording disease in your cattle and how they perform</li>
  <li>checking with your vet or adviser so you can jointly spot existing health problems in livestock, rate them in economic importance, decide which problems to deal with and set your targets</li>
  <li>making management, husbandry, treatment or vaccination changes to reach your targets</li>
  <li>monitoring and reviewing your results against your targets and changing them according to experience</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fhp-in-a-dairy-herd">
<abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> in a dairy herd</h3>

<p>For a dairy herd, <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> should cover the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>fertility</li>
  <li>milk quality and mastitis</li>
  <li>lameness</li>
  <li>infectious and parasitic disease</li>
  <li>nutrition</li>

<p>The West Midlands pilot sheep <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> project is an example of first-time <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> for sheep farms.</p>

<p>One of the farms in the pilot project found that increasing the survival rate of lambs by just 5 per cent brought in enough extra income to cover the costs of setting up and running the health plan.</p>

<h3 id="poultry-and-game-fhp">Poultry and game <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr>

<h2 id="disposal-of-fallen-stock">Disposal of fallen stock</h2>

<p>The disposal of fallen stock and animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>) not intended for human consumption is regulated in England by the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005.</p>

<p>As of 4 March 2011, revised animal by-products regulations in the European Union introduce a risk-based approach to the <abbr title="animal by-product">ABP</abbr> regime. You can find news on the pending changes in the <abbr title="animal by-product">ABP</abbr> regime on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/byproducts"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>‘Fallen stock’ can be any animal that has:</p>

<ul>
<li>died of natural causes or disease on the farm</li>
  <li>been killed on the farm for reasons other than human consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>The National Fallen Stock Company (<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>) is a non-profit organisation that runs the voluntary National Fallen Stock Scheme for the collection and disposal of fallen stock.</p>

<p>Read our related guides for more detailed information on dealing with animal by-products and fallen stock.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-fallen-stock">Disposing of fallen stock</h3>

<p>You must not bury or burn fallen stock in the open, other than in exceptional circumstances - eg the outbreak of a notifiable disease - as this risks spreading disease through groundwater or air pollution.</p>

<p>When you find fallen stock, you should arrange for it to go to an approved:</p>

<ul>
<li>knacker</li>
  <li>hunt kennel</li>
  <li>incinerator</li>
  <li>renderer</li>
  <li>maggot farm</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do this either by private arrangement or under the National Fallen Stock Scheme. For more information, you can contact the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 054 8888.</p>

<p>To find an approved knacker, hunt kennel, incinerator, maggot farm or renderer, you should contact your <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. You must immediately contact your <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> if you think an animal has died of a notifiable disease.</p>

<h3 id="fallen-cattle-aged-over-48-months">Fallen cattle aged over 48 months</h3>

<p>Fallen cattle over 48 months of age must be tested for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (<abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>), which is a form of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (<abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathy">TSE</abbr>). Fallen cattle over 24 months that were born outside Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK must also be tested for <abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must contact a collector within 24 hours of your animal’s death, to arrange delivery to an approved sampling site within 72 hours. If you are delivering the carcass yourself, you must contact an approved sampling site to agree this within 24 hours and must deliver the carcass within 72 hours of the animal’s death.</p>

<p>Fallen cattle aged 48 months or under should be disposed of in accordance with animal by-products legislation.</p>

<p>You can download a list of approved premises for <abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathy">TSE</abbr> testing of fallen cattle on the <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/publications/managing-disease/TSE_%20approved_%20plants.pdf"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 52K).</a></p>
