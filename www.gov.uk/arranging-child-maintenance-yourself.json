There&rsquo;s little paperwork and it means you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>agree how much the payments should be and when they should be made</li>\n  <li>pay for or get things like clothing for your child instead of money, if you both agree</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For example, you could both agree that the paying parent pays:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a proportion of their income</li>\n  <li>a lump sum at different points in the child&rsquo;s life</li>\n  <li>for things like school clothes instead of giving money</li>\n  <li>a regular set amount directly to the parent with care</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you agree to have a regular set amount, you can use the <a href=\"/calculate-child-maintenance\" title=\"child maintenance calculator\">child maintenance calculator</a> to work out what it should be.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about family-based arrangements on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cmoptions.org/en/options/family-based-arrangement.asp\" title=\"family-based arrangements\">Child Maintenance Options</a> website. </p>\n\n<h2>Court orders</h2>\n\n<p>You can also arrange child maintenance and enforce payments <a href=\"/money-property-when-relationship-ends/apply-for-consent-order\" title=\"arranging child maintenance through the courts\">through the courts</a>. This is done using a consent order.</p>\n\n<p>Child maintenance is usually arranged this way if you&rsquo;re already going to court for another reason, eg to get a divorce. </p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you\u2019re only going to court to arrange child maintenance, it\u2019ll be expensive - and <a href=\"/legal-aid\" title=\"legal aid\">legal aid</a> won\u2019t cover the costs.</p>\n</div>\n"}],["tags",[{"title":"Having a child and adoption","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/births-deaths-marriages%2Fchild-adoption.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Legal rights, birth certificates, parental rights and child maintenance","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=births-deaths-marriages%2Fchild-adoption","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages/child-adoption"},"parent":{"title":"Births, deaths, marriages, parenting and care","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/births-deaths-marriages.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes civil partnerships and lasting power of attorney","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=births-deaths-marriages","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Marriage, civil partnership and divorce","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/births-deaths-marriages%2Fmarriage-divorce.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes registry offices, decree absolutes and looking after children","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=births-deaths-marriages%2Fmarriage-divorce","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages/marriage-divorce"},"parent":{"title":"Births, deaths, marriages, parenting and care","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/births-deaths-marriages.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes civil partnerships and lasting power of attorney","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=births-deaths-marriages","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[{"title":"Looking after children if you divorce or separate","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/looking-after-children-divorce.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"722","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"Calculate child maintenance","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/calculate-child-maintenance.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/calculate-child-maintenance","format":"transaction","details":{"need_id":"1980","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"Arranging Child Maintenance through the Child Support Agency","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/arranging-child-maintenance-through-child-support-agency.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/arranging-child-maintenance-through-child-support-agency","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"148","business_proposition":false}}]]],"parts":null}
