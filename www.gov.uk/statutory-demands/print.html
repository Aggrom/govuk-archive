  </header><p>A statutory demand can be used to ask for payment of a debt from an individual or company.</p>

<p>When an individual or company gets a statutory demand, they have 21 days to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>settle the debt</li>
  <li>reach an agreement to pay</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s no agreement, whoever issues the statutory demand can start: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/creditor-bankruptcy-petitions" title="creditor bankruptcy petitions">bankruptcy proceedings</a> (against individuals who owe £750 or more)</li>
  <li>
<a href="/wind-up-a-company-that-owes-you-money" title="Wind up a company">winding up</a> a limited company that owes more than £750</li>
</ul>

  </header><p>Choose the form for your circumstances and <a href="/statutory-demands/how-to-serve-a-statutory-demand" title="How to serve a statutory demand">deliver it</a> to the individual or company that owes you money.</p>

<h2>Forms to send to individuals (including self-employed people)</h2>

</div>

</article><article id="how-to-serve-a-statutory-demand"><header><h1>Part 3: How to serve a statutory demand</h1>
  </header><p>You must make sure the person or company who owes money know that they have the statutory demand.</p>

<p>You should either:</p>

<ul>
<li>deliver (‘serve’) it in person (to an individual, a company director, an employee )</li>
  <li>get a ‘process server’ to serve it for you (a solicitor can arrange this)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If it can’t be delivered in person, you can send it by registered post or put it through a letterbox.</p>
</div>

<h2>If your demand is ignored</h2>

<p>You must fill in a form confirming that you ‘served’ the demand properly. </p>

<p>Use the form as part of your application to start:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/creditor-bankruptcy-petitions" title="creditor bankruptcy petitions">bankruptcy proceedings</a> (for individuals)</li>
  <li>
<a href="/wind-up-a-company-that-owes-you-money" title="Wind up a company">winding up proceedings</a> (for limited companies)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The demand was served personally (by you or someone else)</h3>

</article><article id="challenge-a-statutory-demand"><header><h1>Part 4: Challenge a statutory demand</h1>
  </header><p>If you’ve been given a statutory demand and you don’t agree with it, you can apply to court to have it ‘set aside’ (cancelled). </p>

<h2>For individuals</h2>

<p>You must apply to court to challenge it within 18 days (22 days or more if you were abroad when you got it).</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Fill in <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/insolvency/docs/forms/ew/form6-04.doc%22Application%20to%20Set%20Aside%20a%20Statutory%20Demand%22" rel="external">Form 6.4 – application to set aside a statutory demand (DOC, 40KB)</a> and <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/insolvency/docs/forms/ew/form6-05.doc%22statement%20to%20set%20aside%20statutory%20demand%22" rel="external">Form 6.5 – statement of truth (DOC, 40KB).</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present the forms at a court - a solicitor or local county court can tell you which one to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court accepts your reasons, it will arrange a hearing to discuss the debt. The deadline for paying the debt will be suspended.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your court hearing is unsuccessful, the time period for you to pay back the debt will restart. If you don’t pay in time and your debt is £750 or more, the creditor can apply to bankrupt you.</p>

<h2>For limited companies</h2>
