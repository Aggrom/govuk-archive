Your child can only be <a href=\"school-discipline-exclusions\" title=\"School discipline and exclusions\">suspended or expelled</a> if they repeatedly ignore the uniform rules.</p>\n\n<h2>Help with the cost of buying uniforms</h2>\n\n<p>Uniforms shouldn&rsquo;t be so expensive that you can&rsquo;t send your child to the school of your choice. If they aren&rsquo;t wearing the uniform because you can&rsquo;t afford it, talk to the head teacher. The school should give you time to buy the right clothes. </p>\n\n<p>You may be able to <a href=\"/apply-help-school-clothing-costs\" title=\"Financial help with the cost of school clothing\">get financial help</a> from your local council.</p>\n\n<h2>Discrimination</h2>\n<p>Schools can decide if girls can wear trousers, or if religious dress is allowed, but they mustn&rsquo;t discriminate based on gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or belief. If you think your child is being discriminated against, talk to the head teacher.</p>\n\n<h2>Complaints about the school uniform</h2>\n<p>If you have a complaint about the uniform, talk to the head teacher and school governors. If the school has a parent/teacher association, they may be able to help. </p>\n\n<div class=\"form-download\">\n<p><a href=\"http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/s/school%20uniform%20guidance%202012.pdf\" title=\"Download 'School uniform guidance' (PDF, 54KB)\">Download &lsquo;School uniform guidance&rsquo; (PDF, 54KB)</a></p>\n</div>\n"}],["tags",[{"title":"School life","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/education%2Fschool-life.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Help with school costs, the curriculum and school attendance","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=education%2Fschool-life","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/education/school-life"},"parent":{"title":"Education","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/education.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Get help if you&#39;re at school, planning to go on to further or higher education, looking for training or interested in a student or career development loan.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=education","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/education"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[]]],"parts":null}
