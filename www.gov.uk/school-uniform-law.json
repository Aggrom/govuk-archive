Your child can only be [suspended or expelled](school-discipline-exclusions \"School discipline and exclusions\") if they repeatedly ignore the uniform rules.\r\n\r\n##Help with the cost of buying uniforms\r\n\r\nUniforms shouldn't be so expensive that you can't send your child to the school of your choice. If they aren't wearing the uniform because you can't afford it, talk to the head teacher. The school should give you time to buy the right clothes. \r\n\r\nYou may be able to [get financial help](/apply-help-school-clothing-costs \"Financial help with the cost of school clothing\") from your local council.\r\n\r\n##Discrimination\r\nSchools can decide if girls can wear trousers, or if religious dress is allowed, but they mustn't discriminate based on gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or belief. If you think your child is being discriminated against, talk to the head teacher.\r\n\r\n##Complaints about the school uniform\r\nIf you have a complaint about the uniform, talk to the head teacher and school governors. If the school has a parent/teacher association, they may be able to help. \r\n\r\n$D[Download 'School uniform guidance' (PDF, 54KB)](http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/s/school%20uniform%20guidance%202012.pdf \"Download 'School uniform guidance' (PDF, 54KB)\")$D","overview":"Each school decides its uniform, which all pupils must wear, but it needs to be affordable and appropriate for all children","slug":"school-uniform-law","title":"School uniform","updated_at":"2012-10-03T11:37:14+00:00","type":"answer"}
