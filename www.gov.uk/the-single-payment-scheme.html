<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) - part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) - is the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s main agricultural subsidy scheme.</p>

<p>If you are a farmer in England who meets the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> rules, you can apply to the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments. These payments are not linked to production, giving you flexibility in how you run your business.</p>

<p>This guide gives an overview of the scheme and explains how to apply for payment. It covers the Cross Compliance requirements, including farmers’ obligations to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition.</p>

<p>This guide also explains how deductions from <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments - known as ‘modulation’ - help fund rural development schemes for farmers, such as England’s Environmental Stewardship schemes. There is also guidance on understanding your entitlements statement, the transfer of entitlements and the allocation for 2011 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-sps">What is the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> is the main agricultural subsidy scheme in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The scheme requires you to adhere to Cross Compliance requirements in order to receive the payments in full. These requirements reflect existing English and European law, or basic good agricultural practice. </p>

<p>In England, the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> is run by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, while the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) takes the lead on <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> policy issues.</p>

<p>Each part of the UK has different <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> arrangements. This guide covers England only. For information about the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, you should contact the relevant agriculture department.</p>

<p>Since 2006, the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> has included additional sugar support of £52 million for sugar beet growers in England. </p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sugar-beet-claiming-payments">sugar beet</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-sps-work">How does the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> work?</h2>

<p>To be eligible for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be a farmer, as defined by the European Union</li>
  <li>have eligible land at your disposal on the prescribed date in May of the scheme year - this land must be eligible for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> for the entire calendar year</li>
  <li>hold payment entitlements </li>
</ul>
<p>You can browse the index to <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> Cross Compliance guidance on the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/21c99ddaeb3232a9802573aa004efa3e!OpenDocument"><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You must also meet the application deadlines set each year. </p>

<h3 id="usage-rule-for-entitlements">Usage rule for entitlements</h3>

<p>You must use an entitlement at least once in two years instead of the previous rule of once in three years. Download the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s SP19 on understanding your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlement statement 2010 from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=236581&amp;id=263889">Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 332K).</a></p>

<h3 id="eligible-land">Eligible land</h3>

<p>Eligible land is defined as any area of your holding taken up by arable land and permanent pasture, except for:</p>

<ul>
<li>forested areas</li>
  <li>areas used for non-agricultural activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions do apply to non-agricultural activities which are divided into three categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>A - permitted without restriction, eg walking, bird watching, fishing</li>
  <li>B - permitted up to a 28 day limit, eg shooting, car boot sales, festivals</li>
  <li>C - inconsistent with the land being considered as remaining in agricultural use, eg golf course, airstrip, game rearing</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/21c99ddaeb3232a9802573aa004efa3e!OpenDocument">browse the index to <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> Cross Compliance guidance on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="entitlements">Entitlements</h3>

<p><abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments are based on entitlements. You must have at least one hectare of eligible land for each entitlement you choose to claim payment on. </p>

<p>In order to use the entitlements to claim payment, no agricultural production is necessary. Claimants still need to comply with Cross Compliance standards however, including keeping land in good agricultural and environmental condition.</p>

<h3 id="set-aside-and-english-reserve-entitlements">Set-aside and English Reserve entitlements</h3>

<p>Unless agri-environment scheme obligations require you to do so, you no longer have to set aside any of your land. Set-aside entitlements are converted to normal entitlements and valued at the relevant <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> flat rate.</p>

<p>You can still choose to voluntarily leave land uncropped and may use this to support normal entitlements. Uncropped land is subject to Cross Compliance requirements, in particular Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition.</p>

<p>English Reserve entitlements no longer exist. They too are converted to normal entitlements at their same value and do not require annual activation.</p>

<h3 id="transfer-of-entitlements">Transfer of entitlements</h3>

<p>You no longer need to be a farmer at the date of transfer to be able to transfer entitlements, ie a farmer can retire and then transfer out entitlements. But the person receiving the entitlements must still be a farmer. Also, you no longer need to have used at least 80 per cent of your 2005 entitlement allocation to be able to transfer entitlements by sale or gift without land.</p>

<h2 id="applications-and-key-dates-for-the-sps">Applications and key dates for the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Applications for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments in England are made through the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. The deadline for receipt of applications is usually around the middle of May of the scheme year.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s payment window for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments runs from 1 December of the scheme year, to the following 30 June.</p>

<p>You can read frequently asked questions on <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> registration on the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/158501c0ecb81268802572c600349816!OpenDocument"><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="key-2013-dates">Key 2013 dates</h3>

<ul>
<li>2 April - last date for <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> to receive your request to transfer entitlements for it to take effect by 15 May 2013, and in time for the 2013 scheme year.</li>
  <li>15 May - the date on which you must have land at your disposal to be eligible for the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>. It is also the final date for receipt of applications without penalty.</li>
  <li>31 May - last date for submitting any amendments arising from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s response to your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> 2013 application.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="sps-online---how-to-apply-electronically">
<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> Online - how to apply electronically</h2>

<p><abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> Online is the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s free web-based service which allows you to submit your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> application electronically. You can also track the progress of your claim and view claim or entitlements statements issued to you for the 2009 scheme year onwards.</p>

You should have received this in late February/early March 2012. If you have not previously applied electronically and need a pin, you should call the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Customer Service Centre on Tel 0845 603 7777.</p>

<p>You can submit your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> application electronically during each scheme year application period. You can access and amend your <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> data, check your application for common errors and correct them before you submit. It will then provide you with an instant on-screen acknowledgement that the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> has received your application.</p>

<p>Once the scheme year application period ends you can still access the make a claim service to view claims previously submitted via <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> Online or a farm software package.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-track-claims">How to track claims</h3>

<ul>
<li>check the progress of your claim at any time without needing to contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>track the progress of your claim from start to finish regardless of whether you submitted the application electronically (using <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> Online or a farm software package) or on the paper SP5 form</li>
  <li>find out if you need to submit more information to progress your claim and reply to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> electronically</li>

<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements</h2>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, entitlements are used as the basis for subsidy payments. An entitlement gives a farmer the right to a payment, provided it is supported by a hectare of eligible land.</p>

<p><abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments are based on entitlements, which were allocated to farmers in 2005. If you do not have any entitlements, or wish to obtain more, you may be able to purchase or lease some from another farmer.</p>

<p>For each entitlement you choose to claim payment on, you must have at least one hectare of eligible land. This minimum area applies to your total claim under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> and Area Payments for Nuts. If you hold special entitlements, your claim will only be valid if the value of your claim is at least €200.</p>

<h3 id="value-of-entitlements-under-the-sps">Value of entitlements under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Currently, <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements are valued on two elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>a flat rate</li>
  <li>an addition - based on any historic reference amount</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of entitlements changes from scheme year to scheme year. </p>

<p>Any payments that the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> makes will be reduced for European and national modulation.</p>

<p>By 2012, the value of all entitlements will be based on a flat rate, with a single value being established for all entitlements in each of the three English areas. As this change takes place, the flat-rate element will gradually rise and the historic element fall.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, England is divided into three regions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-Severely Disadvantaged Area - England outside the upland Severely Disadvantaged Area</li>
  <li>Severely Disadvantaged Area - English upland SDA other than moorland</li>
  <li>Severely Disadvantaged Area Moorland - English moorland within the upland SDA</li>
</ul>
<p>Within each region, there are two types of entitlement - normal and special. Land in a specific region can only be used to support entitlements in that same region.</p>

<h3 id="entitlement-to-payments-under-the-sps">Entitlement to payments under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you own entitlements you have the right to claim a payment under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> subject to certain conditions being met.</p>

<p>You can transfer entitlements to increase or reduce the number you hold. </p>

<p>If your land was in more than one UK region, or was in different areas of England, any reference amount you had will have been allocated between the areas you farmed in 2005.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-sps-entitlement">Types of <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlement</h3>

<p><abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements fall into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>normal entitlement - code NML</li>
  <li>special entitlement - code SPE</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="activating-sps-entitlements">Activating <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements</h3>

<p>Your entitlements can be activated for payment - ie claimed - in each year you apply under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>To activate all your entitlements, you must have sufficient land to support your claim at your disposal for one day - 15 May (unless that falls on a weekend).</p>

<h3 id="usage-rule-for-sps-entitlements">Usage rule for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements</h3>

<p>If you do not claim an entitlement for two years it will be taken away from you and put into the National Reserve - except in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>You can rotate entitlements to make sure they are used at least once in any two-year period but can only use them in the area of England where they were established.</p>

<h3 id="sps-entitlements-subject-to-special-conditions">
<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements subject to special conditions</h3>

<p>If you had no eligible land, or entitlements over a certain value in 2005, then you were able to apply for entitlements subject to special conditions. These conditions related to the number of livestock on a holding in the year of claim.</p>

<p>To activate special entitlements for payment, a farmer must maintain at least 50 per cent of the level of agricultural activity, expressed in Livestock Units kept during the reference period.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-of-special-sps-entitlements-into-normal-sps-entitlements">Conversion of special <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements into normal <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements</h3>

<p>Special entitlements will be permanently converted into normal entitlements if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you do not confirm on the application form that you wish your entitlements to retain their special status</li>
  <li>when completing your field data sheet, you declare more eligible land for the activation of entitlements than is needed to activate your normal entitlements</li>
  <li>you transfer out special entitlements</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of Livestock Units needed to activate any remaining special entitlements for payments will be reduced pro rata to take account of the conversion.</p>

<h3 id="the-sps-entitlements-statement">The <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements statement</h3>

<p>The entitlement statement for the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> shows the number of English entitlements that you held on the application deadline date for a specific scheme year. The statement also shows the new value in euros of each entitlement but does not show any entitlements transferred in or out.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you keep your entitlements statement for your records and refer to it when you complete subsequent <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> application forms.</p>

<p>Download guidance on <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements from the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/E508CA20B607128B8025725A003A0D37?Opendocument"><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website (PDF, 85K).</a></p>

<h2 id="transfer-of-entitlements-under-the-sps">Transfer of entitlements under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Farmers can transfer <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements at any time of the year. Since 1 January 2009, there is no longer a requirement for the transferor - the person making a transfer - to be a farmer.</p>

<p>Entitlement transfers can be made:</p>

<ul>
<li>by sale or gift - with or without land </li>
  <li>by lease with land </li>
  <li>through inheritance </li>
  <li>through merger or scission - ie splitting - of a business</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-transfer-sps-entitlements">How to transfer <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements</h3>

<p>To transfer <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> entitlements, you must complete and return an RLE 1 application form. You can request this form by calling the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 603 7777.</p>

<p>You should use the RLE 1 form to:</p>

<ul>
<li>transfer entitlements - with or without land</li>
  <li>transfer entitlements by lease with land </li>
  <li>surrender entitlements </li>
  <li>transfer land and/or make a permanent boundary change</li>
</ul>
<p>To request the right amount of RLE 1 forms you will need the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single Business Identifier (SBI) </li>
  <li>primary business address </li>
  <li>the reason you are requesting the RLE 1 form </li>
  <li>the number of businesses to which you are transferring entitlements </li>
  <li>the number of land parcels you wish to transfer</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, the RLE 1 form will already contain as much detail as possible relevant to your specific transfer. Where it is not possible to send you a pre-populated RLE 1, a blank form will be issued.</p>

<p>You must notify the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> at least six weeks before a transfer of entitlements is due to take place. If you fail to do this, the transfer will take effect six weeks from the date that <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> receives the form. If <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> does not contact you within six weeks to object to the transfer, the transfer will take effect from the date stated on the form.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-the-environment-with-cross-compliance">Protecting the environment with Cross Compliance</h2>

<p>In order to receive the full <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payment - and certain Rural Development scheme payments - you must comply with a set of Statutory Management Requirements. These relate to areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare. You must also demonstrate that you are keeping your land in good agricultural and environmental condition. This is known as ‘Cross Compliance’. All agricultural activities are covered by Cross Compliance and you must comply with the requirements across the whole agricultural area of your holding, regardless of the amount of land you entered into the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>These standards are based on existing European and domestic legal requirements, or basic good agricultural practice that you should already be following.</p>

<p>For technical advice and queries you can call the Cross Compliance Helpline on 0845 345 1302.</p>

<p>The Cross Compliance standards also apply to anyone claiming Area Payment for Nuts, Protein Crop Premium and certain Rural Development schemes.</p>

<h3 id="further-advice-on-cross-compliance">Further advice on Cross Compliance</h3>

<p>You can find up-to-date guidance for farmers on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/21c99ddaeb3232a9802573aa004efa3e!OpenDocument"><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You must also complete an annual template for Cross Compliance soil protection purposes. You can complete your Soil Protection Review 2012 template manually or electronically.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-sps-helps-fund-rural-development">How the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> helps fund rural development</h2>

<p>‘Modulation’ is a levy on CAP direct payments - including the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> - to support rural development, such as the agri-environment schemes.</p>

<p>There are two types of modulation levy - European and national - which are both deducted from <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments and other agricultural subsidies.</p>

<p>Modulation applies to the following types of direct payments made to farmers:</p>

<ul>
<li><abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr></li>
  <li>Area Payments for Nuts</li>
  <li>Protein Crop Premium</li>
  <li>Aid for Energy Crops</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="modulation-levy-rates">Modulation levy rates</h3>

<p>Rates of modulation are set at <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and national levels, as a percentage of direct payments made to farmers. In England, for 2009-12, total modulation, including <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and national modulation, will be 19 per cent.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> modulation deductions do not apply to the first €5,000 of direct payments. This exemption does not apply to national modulation.</p>

<p>Some of the proceeds from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> modulation are shared out among the original 15 <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states but most of the funds are kept within the originating member state. All the proceeds from national modulation are kept by the originating member state.<br>
 <br>
Separate arrangements for national modulation apply in the devolved administrations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-to-businesses">Benefits to businesses</h3>

<p>In England, modulation payments help pay for the Rural Development Programme for England. This includes the Entry Level Stewardship agri-environment scheme, for which all farmers are eligible to apply and which is designed to deliver environmental benefits over and above Cross Compliance requirements.</p>

<p>Modulation attracts matched funding from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> budget.</p>

<h2 id="other-funding-for-farmers">Other funding for farmers</h2>

<p>As well as the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, there are other types of support available through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

<p>If you receive CAP payments or certain other Rural Development Scheme payments, you must meet Cross Compliance requirements. These requirements apply across all farming activities.</p>

<h3 id="dehydrated-fodder-scheme">Dehydrated Fodder Scheme</h3>

<p>The aim of the dehydrated fodder scheme is to encourage the production and use of European Community produced protein crops. Payments for most schemes are made during set payment windows. The dehydrated fodder scheme payment window, for example, starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March the following year.</p>

<h3 id="area-payment-for-nuts-scheme">Area Payment for Nuts Scheme</h3>

<p>Payments are linked to the area of eligible nuts grown.</p>

<p>There is a minimum tree density per hectare for each eligible nut variety:</p>

<ul>
<li>almonds - 50</li>
  <li>hazelnuts or filberts - 125</li>
  <li>walnuts - 50</li>
  <li>pistachios - 50</li>
  <li>locust beans (carob pods) - 30</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications for the scheme must be made to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> using the annual <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> application form (SP5). Applicants do not have to be claiming under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Orchards must be a minimum size of 0.1 hectares. The average payment will be €120.75 per hectare. If the UK’s National Guaranteed Area of 100 hectares is exceeded, then payments will be reduced. The payment will also be reduced 19 per cent for modulation.</p>
