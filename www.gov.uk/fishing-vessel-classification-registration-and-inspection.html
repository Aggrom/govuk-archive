<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide explains fishing vessel classification and certification. It also provides information on survey and inspection requirements and procedures and how a vessel can prepare for this. You will also find details on how to register a vessel.</p>

<h2 id="fishing-vessels-classification-and-certification">Fishing vessels classification and certification</h2>

<p>Fishing vessels are classified according to their length in metres.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessels-less-than-24-metres-in-length">Fishing vessels less than 24 metres in length</h3>

<p>Fishing vessels less than 24 metres are covered by the Small Fishing Vessels Code of Practice (less than 15 metres length overall (<abbr title="length overall">LOA</abbr>)) and the Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction and Use of 15 metres <abbr title="length overall">LOA</abbr> to less than 24 metres Registered Length Fishing Vessels.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessels-24-metres-in-length-and-over">Fishing vessels 24 metres in length and over</h3>

<p>Fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over are covered by the Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999 as amended in 2003, which amended and implemented the Torremolinos Protocol in the UK.</p>

<p>Where applicable, the Fishing Vessels (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975 also apply to vessels built before 1999. These rules and the Torremolinos Protocol are not available online but you can purchase the Protocol from International Maritime Organisation (<abbr title="International Maritime Organisation">IMO</abbr>) Publications. <a rel="external" href="http://www.imo.org/Publications/Documents/Catalogue%20and%20book%20code%20list/English/Catalogue.pdf">Download the publications catalogue 2011 from the <abbr title="International Maritime Organisation">IMO</abbr> website (PDF, 4.41MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="certification">Certification</h3>

<p>Fishing vessels are exempt from some certification requirements, although other specialised certificates must be carried, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>a UK Fishing Vessel certificate (<abbr title="United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate">UKFVC</abbr>) - for vessels 15-24 metres in length</li>
  <li>an International Fishing Vessel certificate (<abbr title="International Fishing Vessel Certificate">IFVC</abbr>) - for vessels 24 metres or longer</li>
  <li>an Oil Pollution Prevention certificate</li>
  <li>an Air Pollution certificate - for vessels of 400 gross tonnes (<abbr title="gross tonnes">gt</abbr>) or more</li>
  <li>a Sewage Pollution certificate - for vessels of 400 <abbr title="gross tonnes">gt</abbr> or more, or carrying up to 15 persons, and on international voyages</li>
  <li>an Anti-fouling declaration - for vessels of less than 24 metres in length and less than 400 <abbr title="gross tonnes">gt</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an Anti-fouling certificate - for vessels of 400 <abbr title="gross tonnes">gt</abbr> or more</li>
  <li>a Certificate of Registry</li>
  <li>an International Tonnage certificate - for vessels of 400 <abbr title="gross tonnes">gt</abbr> or more</li>
</ul>
<p>For information about the certification of fishing vessels, see <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-shipsurveysandinspecs.htm">vessel survey and inspection requirements on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fishing-vessel-surveys-and-inspections">Fishing vessel surveys and inspections</h2>

<p>There are separate certifications, and different survey and inspection requirements, for fishing vessels that are:</p>

<ul>
<li>less than 15 metres in <abbr title="length overall">LOA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>from 15 metres in <abbr title="length overall">LOA</abbr> to less than 24 metres registered length</li>
  <li>over 24 metres in registered length</li>
</ul>
<p>Fishing vessels less than 15 metres in length are covered by the Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/msn_1813_amended_5.pdf">Download <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1813 (F) The Fishing Vessels Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 362K)</a>.</p>

<p>A separate Code of Practice sets out the requirements for fishing vessels of between 15 and 24 metres in length. <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/1770_a.pdf">Download <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1770 (F) The Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction and Use of 15-24 Metre Fishing Vessels from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 1.23MB)</a>.</p>

<p>Fishing vessels of 24 metres and over in length are covered by the 1975 Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Rules, as amended, and the Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime Directive) Regulations 1999.</p>

<p>In general, all fishing vessels must be surveyed before entering service to make sure that they comply with the appropriate certification requirements. Vessels less than 15 metres in length must be built to Seafish construction standards, surveyed against these standards by Seafish and then inspected by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> prior to registration as a fishing vessel. These vessels must then be inspected by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> every five years to continue working. The owner of the vessel, or their representative, is also required to self-certify annually.</p>

<p>Vessels of 15 metres in length to less than 24 metres must also be built to, and surveyed against, Seafish Construction Standards and then surveyed by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> before registration. These vessels must have a full renewal survey every five years with a mid-term inspection to maintain the <abbr title="United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate">UKFVC</abbr>. The owner of the vessel, or their representative, also needs to self-certify annually.</p>

<p>Vessels of 24 metres in length and over must be built to Classification Society Standards and surveyed by the relevant society to make sure it meets those standards. It must then be surveyed by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> prior to registration. The <abbr title="International Fishing Vessel Certificate">IFVC</abbr> lasts four years and in that time they must be surveyed annually by the Classification Society, have an intermediate survey by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> after two years, and have full renewal survey after four years. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> provides guidance for owners of small fishing vessels on preparing for surveys. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/how_to_prepare_for_survey_2009.pdf">Download a survey preparation guide for vessels up to 15 metres from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 510K)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fishing-vessel-inspection-and-survey-requirements-and-procedures">Fishing vessel inspection and survey requirements and procedures</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> surveys all UK commercial fishing vessels above 15 metres in overall length in order to make sure they comply with legal safety requirements. </p>

<p>Once your vessel has passed the survey, it will be provided with the relevant safety certificate.</p>

<p>For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, this certificate is the <abbr title="International Fishing Vessel Certificate">IFVC</abbr>. For this to remain in force you need to make sure that there is:</p>

<ul>
<li>an annual survey of the vessel - by a classification society if the vessel is classed</li>
  <li>an annual survey of the vessel - by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> to the standards of a classification society if the vessel is not classed</li>
  <li>an intermediate survey three months either side of the second anniversary of the certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>For vessels of 15 metres in length to less than 24 metres, the required certificate is the United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate. To remain in force the vessel needs to have an inspection between 24 and 36 months after the certificate is issued.</p>

<p>Commercial fishing vessels under 15 metres in length require inspections instead of surveys. If the vessel passes the inspection, it will be awarded the Small Fishing Vessel Certificate (<abbr title="Small Fishing Vessel Certificate">SFVC</abbr>) (Merchant Service Fee (<abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr>) 1316).</p>

<p>All commercial fishing vessels need the appropriate Fishing Vessel Certificate before they can go to sea.</p>

<h3 id="survey-requirements-for-fishing-vessels-15-24-metres-in-length">Survey requirements for fishing vessels 15-24 metres in length</h3>

<p>For commercial fishing vessels 15-24 metres in length, the survey requirements cover safety standards set out in <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1770 Code of Safe Working Practice for the Construction &amp; Use of 15 metres <abbr title="length overall">LOA</abbr> to Less than 24 metres RL Fishing Vessels.</p>

<h3 id="survey-requirements-for-fishing-vessels-over-24-metres-in-length">Survey requirements for fishing vessels over 24 metres in length</h3>

<p>For fishing vessels over 24 metres, the survey requirements cover the safety standards set out in:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Over 24 metres Code of Safe Working Practice - due for publication soon</li>
  <li>Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999, as amended in 2003</li>
  <li>the International Maritime Organisation Torremolinos Protocol and the Fishing Vessels (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975, as amended</li>

<h3 id="fishing-vessel-construction-survey-procedure">Fishing vessel construction survey procedure</h3>

<p>For fishing vessels of 15 metres in length and above the procedure involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>applying using form <abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 5100 together with your fee deposit</li>
  <li>submitting of plans to the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> surveyor for approval</li>
  <li>visits - the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> surveyor will visit your yard during construction, and they will work with Seafish surveyors or class surveyors to make sure the relevant Code of Safe Working Practice and the Seafish certificate of construction (for vessels 15-24 metres in length) is complied with</li>
  <li>final visit - when the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> surveyor carries out stability and operational tests and a general inspection of staffing levels, qualifications, health and safety procedures,  and whether crew are familiar with all the equipment and emergency drills etc</li>
  <li>sea trials - discretionary attendance</li>
</ul>
<p>When the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> surveyor visits, they will need external and internal access to all areas of the vessel. They will only allow exemptions from the survey standards if they can see that equivalent materials or systems are in place.</p>

<p>Renewal surveys usually need two visits from the surveyor, one out of water and one afloat, to carry out operational and stability tests.</p>

<p>If the surveyor isn’t satisfied with the survey, they will provide a list of defects and may return later to check that they have been resolved. The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> surveyor may also decide to detain the vessel.</p>

<p>If the vessel passes the survey, the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> will issue the relevant United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate (<abbr title="United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate">UKFVC</abbr>), which covers a specific period. In order to make sure the certificate is still valid during this period, the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> or Classification Society will carry out intermediate inspections or annual and intermediate surveys, dependent on the size of the vessel. Vessels of 15-24 metres in length are also required to conduct annual self certifications.</p>

<h3 id="inspection-of-fishing-vessels-under-15-metres-in-length">Inspection of fishing vessels under 15 metres in length</h3>

<p>Fishing vessels under 15 metres in length require inspections instead of surveys. From 2011, the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> will introduce a new Small Fishing Vessel Code that requires fishing vessels under 15 metres in length to have a <abbr title="Small Fishing Vessel Certificate">SFVC</abbr> (<abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 1316). These certificates have been issued from July 2010.</p>

<p>Inspections are carried out by <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> surveyors or inspectors to make sure that fishing vessels which are less than 15 metres in length meet the requirements of <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr> 1813, the Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels. Inspections are free of charge.</p>

<p>To pass the inspection, your fishing vessel must meet a range of safety requirements and carry the following documents:</p>

<ul>
<li>a list of crew on all fishing vessels over 12.2 metres (40 ft) in length, with a copy kept at an address within the UK</li>
  <li>

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-for-a-vessel-survey">How to prepare for a vessel survey</h2>

<p>Fishing vessels 15 metres in <abbr title="length overall">LOA</abbr> and over that are registered in the UK must have a <abbr title="United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate">UKFVC</abbr> or an <abbr title="International Fishing Vessel Certificate">IFVC</abbr>.</p>

<p>A vessel can be surveyed to make sure it meets safety standards up to six months before its existing certificate expires. The survey can be completed in two visits - although additional visits may be necessary depending on the surveyors’ findings. You should have all your records and certification ready for inspection before the survey begins.</p>

<p>The two main elements of a fishing vessel inspection are:</p>

<ul>
<li>an ‘out of water’ survey</li>
  <li>an ‘afloat’ survey, including stability checks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="out-of-water-survey">Out of water survey</h3>

<p>You can prepare your fishing vessel for an ‘out of water’ survey by:</p>

<ul>
<li>pressure washing the hull</li>
  <li>carrying out ultra-sonic tests on the total hull area and any suspect areas on steel vessels</li>
  <li>removing and cleaning sea valves, - inlets and overboard</li>
  <li>checking draft marks</li>
  <li>checking propeller shaft clearances by lifting the shaft and using a clock gauge or feeler gauges</li>
  <li>checking the propeller hub condition and operation - eg if it’s a controlled pitch propeller</li>
  <li>recording rudder pintle bearing clearances</li>
  <li>ensuring safe access for the surveyor to all areas of vessel</li>
  <li>having a shipwright present during the survey visit to discuss any action needed with the surveyor if the vessel is wooden</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="afloat-survey">Afloat survey</h3>

<p>An afloat survey will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a lightship check</li>
  <li>an inclining or roll test</li>
  <li>a stability assessment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="radio-survey">Radio survey</h3>

<p>A radio survey should also be booked as part of the overall survey. It must be carried out before a <abbr title="United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate">UKFVC</abbr> or <abbr title="International Fishing Vessel Certificate">IFVC</abbr> can be issued to the vessel owner.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> provides a list of organisations authorised to survey radio installations on fishing vessels. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/please_click_here-10">Download contact information for authorised surveyors of radio installations on passenger ships, fishing vessels and unclassed cargo vessels from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 55K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="on-board-survey">On board survey</h3>

<p>During an on board survey of a fishing vessel, the surveyor will check areas such as the:</p>

<ul>
<li>wheelhouse</li>
  <li>wheelhouse top</li>
  <li>casing top</li>
  <li>shelter top</li>
  <li>accommodation</li>
  <li>main deck</li>
  <li>fish room</li>
  <li>engine room</li>
  <li>equipment tests</li>
  <li>vessel operations and drills</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for remote winch stops, fishing gear is not tested during a <abbr title="United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate">UKFVC</abbr> or <abbr title="International Fishing Vessel Certificate">IFVC</abbr> inspection.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-gear">Fishing gear</h3>

<p>Fishing gear is tested independently of <abbr title="United Kingdom Fishing Vessel Certificate">UKFVC</abbr>/<abbr title="International Fishing Vessel Certificate">IFVC</abbr> certification under the regulations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provision and Use of Work Equipment - Marine Guidance Note (<abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr>) 331 (M+F) - non-lifting equipment on fishing vessels</li>
  <li>Guide to Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations - <abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr> 332 (M+F) - lifting equipment on fishing vessels</li>

<h2 id="registering-fishing-vessels">Registering fishing vessels</h2>

<p>A fishing vessel is a boat used to catch sea fish for profit, even if it is only used occasionally. Every British sea fishing vessel - with certain exceptions - that fishes for profit must be registered by law.</p>

<p>All fishing vessels that catch sea fish for profit must also have a licence issued by the appropriate Fisheries Department. You should contact your Local Fisheries Office about licensing at the same time as applying for registration.</p>

<p>You can get full or simple registration for a fishing vessel.</p>

<p>Full registration requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>proof of ownership, including Bills of Sale</li>
  <li>builders certificate for new vessels</li>
  <li>forms <abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 4740, <abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 4728 including a declaration of the maximum continuous engine power (<abbr title="maximum continuous or permanently de-rated engine power">MCEP</abbr>), <abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 4705 and <abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 4743</li>
</ul>
<p>A vessel with full registration can have mortgages registered against it.</p>

<p>Simple registration requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>an accepted receipted invoice</li>
  <li>forms <abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 4740, <abbr title="Merchant Service Fee">MSF</abbr> 4728, including a declaration of the <abbr title="maximum continuous or permanently de-rated engine power">MCEP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mortgages cannot be recorded against a vessel with simple registration.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-register">How to Register</h3>

<p>You will need to complete a British ship form and submit it with the appropriate fees and support documentation, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>a copy of certificate of incorporation - if the owner is a body corporate</li>
  <li>safety certificate - for vessels over 15 metres</li>
  <li>International Tonnage Certificate (ITC69) - if the vessel is over 15 metres</li>
  <li>Seafish Certificate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="carving-and-marking">Carving and Marking</h3>

<p>On receiving your application, the vessel will be issued with a Carving and Marking note. The vessel must be carved and marked and measured by an Authorised Measurer. A measurement  of vessels:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 metres in length and over is carried out by one of the classification society surveyors, who complete a certificate of measurement and an International Convention certificate 1969</li>
  <li>under 15 metres in length in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is carried out by a local Coastguard - in Scotland measurement is carried out by a local fishery officer and a certificate of measurement only is issued for these vessels</li>
</ul>
<p>The Carving and Marking note and the measurement certificate are then to be returned to the UK Ship Register in Cardiff, along with the appropriate fee.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-ukshipregister/mcga-ukshipregister-merchantships/mcga-ukshipregister-feesandcosts">find a list of fees on the UK Ship Register website</a>.</p>

<p>When you apply to register, you must have a list of nominated names for the vessel. These names must be unique to the port that you wish to register under. A Certificate of Registry is valid for five years and must be renewed if you want to continue to fish for profit.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessel-survey">Fishing vessel survey</h3>

<p>A fishing vessel must be surveyed before it can be registered.</p>

<p>In most cases surveys are carried out by a UK Ship Register surveyor. However, under certain circumstances, surveys can be carried out by a Class surveyor on our behalf.</p>

<p>To avoid any lost time, a transfer of flag survey can be arranged to suit the working pattern of your vessel.</p>

<p>The Principal Fishing Surveyor (<abbr title="Principal Fishing Surveyor">PFS</abbr>) will request a copy of all existing statutory certification in order that new certificates can be prepared prior to survey.</p>

<p>If, during a survey, your vessel meets international standards of safety and pollution prevention, a short-term certification can be issued immediately. Full term certification would then follow in due course.</p>

<p>Details of certification, plans and operational information will be discussed by the owner and the <abbr title="Principal Fishing Surveyor">PFS</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="small-fishing-vessel-survey">Small fishing vessel survey</h3>

<p>If you own a fishing vessel that is under 15 metres in <abbr title="length overall">LOA</abbr>, it will not be subject to a regular statutory survey. However, UK law requires that registered small fishing vessels are seaworthy and equipped to a safe standard so still need to have regular inspections.</p>

<p>If your vessel was built after 16 July 2007, its construction must conform to the Seafish standard for small fishing vessels. If your vessel does not conform to this standard you will not be able to register it. The only way to ensure that your vessel does conform is for Seafish to oversee the construction.</p>

<p>If your vessel was built prior to 16 July 2007, you will need to prove that the vessel is seaworthy. To do this, you will need to go through Seafish who will complete a registration inspection.</p>

<p>Seafish will examine the structure of your vessel against their standard for small fishing vessels.</p>

<p>The UK registry will then examine the Seafish report and either:</p>

<ul>
<li>allow registration</li>
  <li>ask you to address areas of concern</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are any areas of concern, you will have to address them before registration can proceed.</p>

<p>Before buying an existing vessel, you should get professional advice on whether it is suitable to be registered as a fishing vessel.</p>

<p>All existing vessels that want to join the fishing vessel register will have to undergo a Seafish survey.</p>

<h3 id="seafish-surveys-fees-and-contact-details">Seafish surveys, fees and contact details</h3>

<p>Seafish charge a fee for the survey of existing vessels.</p>

<p>To arrange Seafish work you should contact them directly. You can call Seafish Marine Services on 01472 252 300 or by Fax on 0131 558 1442. You can also contact them by email at <a href="mailto:information@seafishmarineservices.com">information@seafishmarineservices.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mca-safety-inspections">
