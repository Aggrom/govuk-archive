</header><article id="what-magistrates-do"><header><h1>Part 1: What magistrates do</h1>
  </header><p>Magistrates are volunteers who hear cases in courts in their community.</p>

<p>Each case is usually heard by 3 magistrates, including a magistrate who is trained to act as a chairperson.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A legal adviser in the court gives advice on the law and makes sure the magistrates follow the right procedures.</p>
</div>

<h2>Criminal cases</h2>

<p>All criminal cases begin in a magistrates’ court.</p>

<p>Magistrates pass the most serious crimes (eg murder, rape and robbery) to the Crown Court. Magistrates decide if the defendant should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>kept in custody - eg a police or court cell</li>
  <li>let out on strict conditions - eg to keep away from named places or people</li>
</ul>
<p>Magistrates deal with crimes like:</p>

<ul>
<li>minor assaults</li>
  <li>motoring offences</li>
  <li>theft</li>
  <li>handling stolen goods</li>
</ul>
<p>Magistrates can give punishments such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>fines</li>
  <li>unpaid work in the community</li>
  <li>prison for up to 6 months (or up to 12 months for more than 1 crime)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Civil and family cases</h2>

<p>Magistrates also hear some civil and family cases involving:</p>

<ul>
<li>unpaid Council Tax</li>
  <li>TV licence evasion</li>
  <li>child custody and adoption</li>
  <li>taking children into care</li>
</ul>
<p>Only experienced magistrates who have had special training can hear family cases.</p>

</article><article id="can-you-be-a-magistrate"><header><h1>Part 2: Can you be a magistrate?</h1>
  </header><p>You need to give up some of your spare time and not everyone can serve as a magistrate.</p>

<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>You don’t need formal qualifications or legal training to become a magistrate.</p>

<p>You will get full training for the role, and a legal adviser in court will help you with questions about the law.</p>

<h2>Age</h2>

<p>You have to be over 18 and under 65.</p>

<p>Magistrates must retire at 70 and are normally expected to serve for at least 5 years.</p>

<h2>Health</h2>

<p>You need to be able to hear clearly, with or without a hearing aid, to listen to a case.</p>

<p>You also need to be able to sit and concentrate for long periods of time.</p>

<h2>Personal qualities</h2>

<p>You need to show you’ve got the right personal qualities, eg that you are:</p>

<ul>
<li>aware of social issues</li>
  <li>mature, understand people and have a sense of fairness</li>
  <li>reliable and committed to serving the community</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>understand documents, follow evidence and communicate effectively</li>
  <li>think logically, weigh up arguments and reach a fair decision</li>
</ul>
<h2>Good character</h2>

<p>It’s unlikely you’ll be taken on if you have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>found guilty of a serious crime</li>
  <li>found guilty of a number of minor offences</li>
  <li>banned from driving in the past 5 to 10 years</li>
  <li>declared bankrupt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conflicts of interest</h2>

<p>You can’t be a magistrate if you work in one of a small number of jobs where there could be a conflict of interest - eg if you are a police officer.</p>

<h2>Time off for magistrate duties</h2>

<p>You will need to be in court for at least 13 days, or 26 half-days, a year.</p>

<p>Discuss with your employer how you will balance your work and magistrate duties.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your employer must, by law, allow you reasonable time off work to serve as a magistrate.</p>
</div>

<p>You will get your rota well in advance, so you can give your employer plenty of notice of when you’ll be in court.</p>

<h2>Pay and allowances</h2>

<p>Magistrates are not paid, but many employers allow their employees time off with pay.</p>

<p>If you lose out on pay, you can claim an allowance at a set rate, as well as allowances for travel and subsistence.</p>

<h2>Training to be a magistrate</h2>

<p>You will need training to be a magistrate.</p>

<p>The training when you start will add up to about 18 hours, or 3 full days, as well as some meetings.</p>

<p>The training could take place over:</p>

<ul>
<li>a long weekend</li>
  <li>weekdays</li>
  <li>short evening sessions over several weeks</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Training usually takes place outside work hours.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="apply-to-be-a-magistrate"><header><h1>Part 3: Apply to be a magistrate</h1>
  </header><h2>Visit your local court</h2>

<p>You should visit your local court at least once, and a few times if you can, to check the role is right for you.</p>

<p>Use the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="court finder">court finder</a> to find your nearest court.</p>

<p>The court can let you know when it’s best to visit and which courtrooms to go and see.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you are invited to an interview, you will be asked to talk about your visits.</p>
</div>

<h2>Find out where to apply</h2>

<p>You need to apply to the advisory committee for your local court.</p>

<p>Check the list of advisory committees to find out if there are any vacancies in your area, and where you need to apply.</p>
