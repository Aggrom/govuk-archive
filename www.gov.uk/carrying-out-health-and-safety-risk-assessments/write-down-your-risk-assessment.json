Keep people away from the hazard - for example, you could put barriers around a furnace so people can\u2019t accidentally get too close.\r\ns3. Organise work so it keeps away from a hazard  - for example, print shops should keep guillotines at the end of production lines, not halfway through them.\r\ns4. Give staff and visitors protective equipment, like glasses, goggles, footwear or protective clothing.\r\ns5. Provide facilities to deal with problems, for example you could put first aid boxes close to hazards or provide washing facilities to reduce contamination risks.","slug":"take-precautions-against-risks","title":"Take precautions against risks"}},{"table":{"body":"% If you employ 5 or more people, you must keep a written record of your risk assessment.%\r\n\r\nYou don't have to record your risk assessment in any particular way, but you can make it easier by using the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE):\r\n\r\n- online risk assessment tool for [offices](http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/office.htm \"Risk assessment tool for offices\"){:rel=\"external\"} or [shops](http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/shop.htm \"Risk assessment tool for shops\"){:rel=\"external\"} \r\n- [examples](http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/casestudies/index.htm \"Example health and safety risk assessments\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\nYou can download a risk assessment template from the HSE.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n\r\n[Download a risk assessment template (DOC, 111KB)](http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/risk-assessment-and-policy-template.doc \"Download a health and safety risk assessment template (Word document, 111KB\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n$D\r\n\r\n*[HSE]: Health and Safety Executive","slug":"write-down-your-risk-assessment","title":"Write down your risk assessment"}},{"table":{"body":"There's no set deadline for you to review or update a health and safety risk assessment. \r\n\r\nBut you should do it regularly - many businesses review their risk assessments once a year. \r\n\r\nYou should also update it when things change in your business, eg you move premises, start using new chemicals or buy new equipment.","slug":"review-and-update-your-risk-assessment","title":"Review and update your risk assessment"}}],"type":"guide"}
