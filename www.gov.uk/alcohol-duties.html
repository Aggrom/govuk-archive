<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you produce or process alcohol in the UK, or are responsible for bringing alcohol into the UK, you and your premises will either need to be registered (eg brewers and cider makers), licensed (eg wine producers and spirits producers) or approved (eg excise warehouses) with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). You will also be liable for paying any excise duty due.</p>

<p>If you produce, stock, distribute, sell or use denatured alcohol, you may need to be authorised or licensed by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>This guide explains how and when you need to account for and pay alcohol duties, and how to apply for registration, an excise licence or approval from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. It also explains how you can bring alcohol into the UK in the course of your business, what reliefs and exemptions there are for certain uses of alcohol, and how to obtain them.</p>

<h2 id="beer-duty">Beer Duty</h2>

<p>Beer Duty is chargeable on the following types of beer if their strength is more than 1.2% alcohol by volume (<abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
<li>ale</li>
  <li>porter</li>
  <li>stout</li>
  <li>any other description of beer</li>
  <li>anything else made or sold described as beer or a beer substitute, including beer mixed with non-alcoholic drinks - eg shandy</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not you have to register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> depends on what your business does with the beer it produces or packages.</p>

<h3 id="beer-duty-when-you-must-register-with-hmrc-and-pay">Beer Duty: when you must register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and pay</h3>

<p>If you produce beer for commercial reasons and its strength exceeds 1.2% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>, you must register as a brewer with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and pay Beer Duty.</p>

<p>If you package beer and want to hold it in duty suspension, you must register as a packager with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you produce beer for scientific reasons - eg for research - you don’t need to register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay Beer Duty, but you must notify <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> of your activities.</p>

<h3 id="register-as-a-brewer-or-packager-with-hmrc">Register as a brewer or packager with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you need to register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, you need to do so for every set of premises where you intend to produce or package beer.</p>

<p>Once you have registered as a brewer or packager, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep specific records and accounts</li>
  <li>calculate any Beer Duty due and make returns</li>
  <li>pay Beer Duty by Direct Debit</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a brewer or packager applying for registration for the first time, you must provide a financial guarantee to cover any Beer Duty due on beer removed from your registered premises to the UK market until it is paid to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You also need to be aware of the guarantee requirements when storing or moving alcohol in duty suspension.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000232&amp;propertyType=document">Read about Beer Duty registration, records, returns and guarantees in Notice 226 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<h3 id="beer-duty-when-it-applies">Beer Duty: when it applies</h3>

<p>Beer is liable for Beer Duty as soon as it is ‘produced’. This is when the earliest of one of the following events takes place - when the beer is:</p>

<ul>
<li>put into any package</li>
  <li>removed from the brewery</li>
  <li>consumed</li>
  <li>lost</li>
  <li>fit for consumption</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="beer-duty-suspension">Beer Duty suspension</h3>

<p>Beer Duty doesn’t have to be paid to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> immediately. You can do the following before duty becomes payable:</p>

<ul>
<li>hold beer you have produced on your registered premises in duty suspension</li>
  <li>send it to other registered premises approved to receive beer in duty suspension</li>
  <li>send it to an excise warehouse approved to hold beer in duty suspension, for storage purposes or in order to carry out certain permitted processes on the beer - eg bottling</li>
  <li>send it to a registered beer packager</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to deposit your beer in an excise warehouse, you will need to be approved as a registered owner of warehoused goods. Also the excise warehouse must have the necessary approval to hold beer in duty suspension.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_028646#P368_44202">Find how to become a registered owner of warehoused goods in Notice 196 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>You may also receive beer in duty suspension into your registered premises and continue to hold it in duty suspension - as long as it is of a class or description that your registration entitles you to hold - from:</p>

<ul>
<li>other registered brewers or packagers</li>
  <li>an excise warehouse</li>
  <li>direct importation or acquisition from a country outside the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>Beer Duty becomes payable to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> when the earliest of the following events takes place:</p>

<ul>
<li>when it leaves duty suspension for sale on the UK market, including in your own retail premises</li>
  <li>the beer is consumed</li>
  <li>you decide you want to pay the duty early, perhaps for accounting purposes - this is called ‘constructive removal’</li>
  <li>the beer is lost or stolen</li>
</ul>
<p>These events are known as ‘duty points’.</p>

<p>If the beer is subject to duty suspension arrangements, the Beer Duty on it becomes payable at the time it passes a duty point - ie when it leaves duty suspension.</p>

<h3 id="beer-duty-returns-and-payments">Beer Duty returns and payments</h3>

<p>You have to submit a Beer Duty return (form EX46) to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> by the 15th day of the month following your accounting period, even if your duty liability is nil. You must then pay any Beer Duty declared on your return by the 25th day of the following month (normally by Direct Debit). For example, if a batch of beer passes a duty point on 16 March, you should include the correct amount of Beer Duty on the return for that period and pay it by 25 April - see sections 15 and 16 of Notice 226.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/forms/viewform.jsp?formId=576">Find form EX46 for Beer Duty returns on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000232#P924_106372">Find out about Beer Duty returns and payments in Notice 226 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<h3 id="beer-duty-rates">Beer Duty rates</h3>

<p>Most beers are charged General Beer Duty at £19.51 per hectolitre % of alcohol. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 4.0% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>, your Beer Duty liability would be £390.20 (£19.51 × 5 × 4.0).</p>

<h3 id="high-strength-beer">High strength beer</h3>

<p>High Strength Beer Duty is charged on beer that exceeds 7.5% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr> and this is in addition to the General Beer Duty. This additional charge is set at 25% of the General Beer Duty rate. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 8.0% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>, your Beer Duty liability is £975.60:</p>

<p>General Beer Duty - £19.51 × 5 × 8 = £780.40</p>

<p>High Strength Beer Duty - £19.51 × 25% = £4.88 × 5 × 8 = £195.20</p>

<h3 id="lower-strength-beer">Lower strength beer</h3>

<p>Lower strength beer which is more than 1.2% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr> but not more than 2.8% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr> is set at 50% of the General Beer Duty rate. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 2.8% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>, your Beer Duty liability will be £136.64:</p>

<p>Lower Strength Beer Duty - £19.51 × 50% = £9.76 × 5 × 2.8 = £136.64</p>

<h3 id="reduced-rates-for-small-brewers">Reduced rates for small brewers</h3>

<p>Small brewers who produced no more than 60,000 hectolitres of beer in the previous calendar year may be entitled to a reduced rate of Beer Duty under the Small Breweries’ Relief scheme. This applies on a sliding scale, starting at a reduction of 50% for production of 5,000 hectolitres or less and decreasing for larger production volumes.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000232&amp;propertyType=document#P365_30595">Read about the Small Breweries’ Relief for small brewers in Notice 226 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<h3 id="different-rates-for-beer-mixed-with-spirits">Different rates for beer mixed with spirits</h3>

<p>If you mix beer with spirits that produces a recognisable increase in the alcoholic strength, even if the majority of the final product is beer, you will have to pay duty on the final product at the Spirits Duty rate.</p>

<p>For more information, see the page in this guide on ’Spirits Duty’.</p>

<h2 id="cider-duty">Cider Duty</h2>

<p>Cider and perry are liable for Cider Duty. Cider and perry are defined as drinks created from fermented apple or pear juice, with a strength of more than 1.2% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr> but less than 8.5% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="producing-cider-or-perry-commercially">Producing cider or perry commercially</h3>

<p>If you produce cider or perry for commercial reasons, but make less than 7,000 litres in any 12-month period, you don’t need to register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay Cider Duty. You do, however, need to complete form CP 33 and return it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>To register as a cider maker, you should complete form CP 30 and return it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You need to send one form for every set of premises where you intend to make cider for sale. You must also submit plans of your premises with your application - this is known legally as ‘making entry’ of your premises. These plans must include details of where your cider-making equipment will be sited on your premises, along with any identifiable markings on the equipment.</p>

<p>As a registered cider maker, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep specific records and accounts</li>
  <li>calculate any Cider Duty due and make monthly returns and payments on time</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a cider maker applying for registration for the first time, you must provide a financial guarantee to cover any Cider Duty due on cider removed from your registered premises to the UK market until it is paid to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You also need to be aware of the guarantee requirements when storing or moving alcohol in duty suspension.

<p>You don’t necessarily have to pay Cider Duty to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> immediately. You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>hold cider that you have made on your registered premises in duty suspension</li>
  <li>send it to another registered cider maker for further processing</li>
  <li>send it to an excise warehouse approved to hold cider in duty suspension, for storage purposes or in order to carry out certain permitted processes on the cider - eg bottling</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to deposit your cider in an excise warehouse, you will need to be approved as a registered owner of warehoused goods. Also the excise warehouse must be approved to hold cider in duty suspension.</p>

<h2 id="denatured-alcohol">Denatured alcohol</h2>

<p>Denatured alcohol is alcohol that has been made unsuitable for drinking by the addition of approved denaturants.</p>

<p>There are three classes of denatured alcohol:</p>

<ul>
<li>completely denatured alcohol (<abbr title="'completely denatured alcohol'">CDA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>industrial denatured alcohol</li>
  <li>trade specific denatured alcohol</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="producing-stocking-distributing-and-selling-denatured-alcohol">Producing, stocking, distributing and selling denatured alcohol</h3>

<p>If you want to do any of the following to denatured alcohol, you must be authorised or licensed by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>produce it</li>
  <li>stock it</li>
  <li>distribute it in wholesale quantities</li>
  <li>sell it - although you can sell retail quantities of <abbr title="'completely denatured alcohol'">CDA</abbr> without any restrictions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-denatured-alcohol">Using denatured alcohol</h3>

<p>You can use any quantities of <abbr title="'completely denatured alcohol'">CDA</abbr> without any restriction. If you want to use other types of denatured alcohol, you will need to obtain authorisation and you must obey any restrictions set on different uses for the different types.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000263&amp;propertyType=document">Read about authorisation and licences for denatured alcohol in Notice 473 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-alcohol-into-the-uk-from-overseas">Bringing alcohol into the UK from overseas</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways you can import alcohol or alcoholic drinks into the UK. The most appropriate method will depend on how frequently you will be importing, whether you are importing from inside or outside the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), and whether excise duty has already been paid on the goods in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. The way you account for and pay UK excise duty due on the imported goods will depend on which particular method you are using.</p>

<h3 id="uk-duty-stamps-1">UK duty stamps</h3>

<p>Whichever method you use to import alcohol into the UK, you should be aware of the legal requirements for fiscal markings - ie duty stamps - on specific alcohol products.</p>

<p>Any bottle or other retail container of spirits, wine or made-wine must bear a UK duty stamp when intended for sale in the UK, if it meets both the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>it contains alcohol of a strength of 30% alcohol by volume (<abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>) or more</li>
  <li>it has a minimum capacity of 35 centilitres</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_025107&amp;propertyType=document%23P10_130">Find UK duty stamp information in <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Notice DS5 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="restrictions-on-wine-imported-into-the-eu">Restrictions on wine imported into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Wine from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> may only be released for consumption within the UK (or anywhere else in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) if it meets certain criteria, including a general minimum actual alcoholic strength of 9% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr> and a maximum total alcoholic strength of 15% <abbr title="'alcohol by volume'">ABV</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="occasional-imports-of-alcohol-in-duty-suspension-from-other-eu-countries">Occasional imports of alcohol in duty suspension from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>If you only import alcohol that is in duty suspension from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on a one-off or infrequent basis, then you can apply to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to become a Temporary Registered Consignee.</p>

<p>You will also have to secure the excise duty due on each consignment by submitting payment to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> before the goods are dispatched.</p>

<h3 id="regular-imports-of-alcohol-in-duty-suspension-from-other-eu-countries">Regular imports of alcohol in duty suspension from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>If you regularly bring alcohol in duty suspension into the UK from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries, you can do one of the following three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>apply for approval as a Registered Consignee</li>
  <li>use the services of a Registered Consignee who will act as your agent and import it for you</li>
  <li>use the services of an authorised warehousekeeper who receives the alcohol on your behalf and stores it in duty suspension in an excise warehouse approved for such a purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>Registered Consignees are not allowed to hold or dispatch excise goods in duty suspension. They must account for the excise duty due on the goods as soon as they are received in the UK, with the duty subsequently being paid under deferment arrangements.</p>

<h3 id="importing-duty-paid-alcohol-from-other-eu-countries">Importing duty-paid alcohol from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>If you wish to import alcohol that has been released for consumption in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country (and is therefore classed as duty-paid goods) into the UK on a commercial basis, you will need to use one of the following UK duty-paid schemes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Registered Commercial Importer scheme - this requires the commercial importer to be approved by and registered with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> - the UK duty due on the goods is secured and subsequently paid under deferment arrangements</li>
  <li>the standard duty-paid scheme - this does not require the commercial importer to be registered - the UK duty due on the goods is secured by submitting payment to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> before the goods are dispatched</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_030387&amp;propertyType=document">Read about the Commercial Importer and Tax Representative schemes in Notice 204B on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="importing-alcohol-from-outside-the-eu">Importing alcohol from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you want to import alcohol from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, it becomes liable for UK excise duty when it reaches the UK. However, the excise duty won’t be payable at that point if one of these applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is delivered to an excise warehouse approved for that purpose</li>
  <li>you are a registered producer and you receive alcohol into your registered premises of a class that your registration entitles you to hold</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_025227&amp;propertyType=document#P233_34775">Read about importing excise goods from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in Notice 197 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="customs-duty-and-vat">Customs Duty and VAT</h3>

<p>For any alcohol brought into the UK, you will also have to follow procedures regarding the payment of Customs Duty and VAT.</p>

<h2 id="reliefs-from-alcohol-duties">Reliefs from alcohol duties</h2>

<p>You may claim relief from duty for alcohol that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>use in the production of foodstuffs - the Alcoholic Ingredients Relief</li>
  <li>use in manufactured goods not intended for human consumption</li>
  <li>apply to a medical or scientific purpose</li>
  <li>use in the manufacture of compounded spirits in specific circumstances - for more information, see ‘Spirits rectifiers and compounders’</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alcoholic-ingredients-relief">Alcoholic Ingredients Relief</h3>

<p>You may be able to either claim a refund on alcohol duty you have paid on spirits, beer, cider or perry, wine and made-wine, or to use duty unpaid alcohol if you manufacture any of the following for wholesale supply:</p>

<ul>
<li>drinks with a strength not exceeding 1.2% alcohol by volume</li>
  <li>chocolates containing no more than 8.5 litres of alcohol per 100 kilograms of chocolate</li>
  <li>other foods - but not drinks - containing no more than 5 litres of alcohol per 100 kilograms of the final product</li>
  <li>vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need authorisation or approval, but you do need to follow specific rules to make a claim.</p>

<p>If you use spirits for medical or scientific purposes, or you use spirits in the manufacture of goods that are not intended to be eaten, you may be able to receive the spirits without payment of Spirits Duty. Alternatively, you may be able to use denatured alcohol.</p>

<p>If you want to use duty-free spirits, you need to apply to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> for authorisation before you can receive duty-free spirits. You can apply using form EX 240.</p>

<h3 id="journeys-between-eu-countries">Journeys between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>If you operate an airline or ship that travels between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries, and you want to sell excise goods - including alcohol - to passengers onboard for them to take away, you must apply to become a Registered Mobile Operator (<abbr title="Registered Mobile Operator">RMO</abbr>).</p>

<p>An export shop is an excise warehouse that can hold alcohol in duty suspension for sale to entitled passengers travelling to a destination outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.
